20-6:
    van eyck:
        is known for his hyper realism
        
        in this we believe in this painting that he's trying to get at that
        christ and god and all that is as real as if you could see them.

        realism and naturalism are rather broad we when look at them
        comparatiely between the early realism we saw in giotto pieves and
        those of van eyck


    he want to bring to light the fact that this is oil and wood

    before this most of the altar pieces we have seen were tempre:
        oil was much more popular in the northern europe, there was that myth
        that van eyck created oil paintings, but we know this not to be true.
        He was one of the first adopters though.

    the piece at the bottom is a strong nudge to christ, the blood of the lamb
    (christ) is being drained into the wooden fountain thing in the center

    this piece was placed in the chappel of some wealthy couple




        

There are sometimes mixture of tempre and oil, first laying down the base in
tempre but then going over and finishing the painting with oil.


20-9:
    Still in the category of 15th century religious images

    another alter piece, done for a chappel that was of the militia company of
    a crossbowman?
        they had a chappen in the church

        he says there is hidden imagry of crosbows in the painting
    
    virgin mary is often dressed in a blue robe, often known as the queen of
    heaven
        we see the fainting of the virgin, she collapses from grief.
            this is a famous invention of van eick that we see imitated by many
            other artists 

            the church of the middle ages suggested that the suffering of the
            virgin was theologically significant.

            because of her unique positin as the mother of jesus, that she
            suffered emotionally as he suffered

            this is part of the larger passion of christ

    theologians speak of the passion of christ and the compassion of the virgin
        emotional intamacy between the virgin and her son

    there is no attempt to depict the scene of the crucifiction, rather this is
    a theatrical depiction - just a gold back ground
        paintings like this are compared to actors on a stage rather than the
        literal crucifiction

    the way people are all packed together in this image reminds us of early
    midevil pieces that do the same



20-8:
    we see a different iconography - portriature
        portriate referes to a recognizable likeness of a realistic person

        you see this emerging in terms of patrons, or people that pay for them

        in the 15th century we see the development of independent portriat
        images - rather than pureley religious iconography

        we see this all over in the 15th century, not just in northern european

    we think that this is not only a portrait but a self portriat
        not 100% sure tho

    the inscription (as i can - but not as I would) seems ot be something
    associated with an eyck
        it seems to be an expression of humility, he does as well as he can but
        not as well as he would like to

    the headdress is contemparrary 15th century costume for upper middle class
    in the netherlands area

20-7:
    another portriat that is very famous in european art

    the first known double portiat of a married couple in european art
        this becomes much more common in the later centuries
