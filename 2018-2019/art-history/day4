In the beginnig (13th century) we can see a cronological jump to when we start
talking about northern european art (towards the end of the 14th century).


Fresco:
    very old, this type of paint dates bac to even the greeks.  Dries very
    fast, though on plaster the image is painted while it is still wet 

    buon fresco:
        'true fresco'

    fresco secco:
        dry fresco, the painting is done on dry surface rather than wet

        more delicate, common in egypt, many still in good condition from being
        sealed in isolated tombs

    glornata: (ger-not-ay)
        section of a painting that would be done in a day, or rather in one
        sitting.  In 14-9 you can see in the sky the lines that divide these
        glornata - looking deeply you can see that those portions of the sky
        were painted in layers seperated by time that are visible to the viewer



    14-9: Another Giotto
        Iconography: 
            people weeping over the death of christ

            see the virgin mary holding jesus

            mary magdalin at his feet

        Could say that Giotto is generally very emotional in his paintings, he
        seems to always choose scenes of high emotions

        We can see not only the realism in his paintings, but also the emotions
        of the people in his paintings.
            historians have related this to a chaning religious culture at the
            time

            there was a great emphasis about the sermon or homolye, the mass
            itself was in latin but the sermon was in common tounge.  These
            images were part of this attempt to 'draw in' the commoners


There was a sort of religious competition at this time, different city states
and specifiily cities in those states would attempt to build the best, biggest
and greatest chappel, this would of course not only be bragging rights but also
bring in more pilgrimage
    I'm sure the great religious paintings were a part of this, grand painting
    depecting significant things from christianity could also draw in these
    pilgrims

There was a large outbreak of the plague in the late 14th century that killed
more than half of the people in Siena


14-10: Duccio
    Comonly regered to as the Maesta (my-es-tah):
        literally the magesty

    Dussio is the great painter in Siena in the earth 14th century - sort of
    the Giotto of Siena


    this took him 3 years, obviously a very large project

    Iconography:
        Virgin Mary holding her child christ, surrounded by various saints

        On the base of Mary's throne is written
            "holy Mother of God, be thou the cause of pease for siena and life
             to Cuccio because he painted the thus"
    
14-12: Duccio
    Obviously the story of Judas betraying Christ, see himkissing christ on the
    cheek to tip off the roman soldiers (temple guards) all clustered around
        you see peter attackig one of the soliders attacking him with a knife

    we still see the byzantine gold sky, but wee an interesting landscape with
    the trees and rocky hill things

Duccio was the great figure in 14th century siena, though he had a variety of
students, one of those which was significant was Simone Martini

14-14: Martini
    Done for a smaller chappels inside of the chaterderal, cathederals had
    multiple altars.

    Lippo Memmi did the two figures on either side

    The scene is of the angel telling mary she will birth christ

    We see a vase of white lillys (between the angel and mary), which are 
    always associated with mary
        mary obviously has a look of uncertainty and fear,
        there is an inscription ingraved into the gold that come from the mouth
        of the angel:
            "Ave gratia plena domius tecum"
            (hail mary full of grace, the lord is with thee)



International GOthic Style: 
    where such things as delicate paintings with niceley proportioned fingers,
    appendages and such
