130th and 14th century in itallian art:
    14-5
        The altar piece

        the style is byzantine

    Early on we have this movement between the italo byzantine and the emerging
    naturalistic style
        the causes of this naturalism has something to do with classical
        revival but the people at this time had a very shaky understanding of
        what roman-grecko art looked like.

    14-8:
        Giotto
   
    14-6:
        Cimbaue, probably giotto's teacher

    Both Giotto and Cimbaue were moving away from the flat byzantine style


    Then we go from flourence to pagua

    14-1 The arena Chapel:
        fresco decorations by giotto

        the iconography has to do with the life of mary and the life of christ

        these are different thant he altar piece, this is more of a narative
            in altar piece, often the people depicted look out at the audience
            and gauge with them directly

        literacy levels were very low, so they used images like those depicted
        to teach things from the bible to the people

    14-9:
        We have emphasized the visual but also the emotional realism.

        THere is a relationship between this type of imagery and modern sermons
        by preachers:
            the emotoinal depiction of the virgin mary and how she felt

       
    Move from flourence to siena

    14-10:
        Duccio, contemperary of Giotto.
        He is also moving away from the style of the italo byzantine and
        developing more 3d/ realistic things in his paintings.


        part of a 2 sided, very large altar piece

        one of the pannels:

        14-12:
            depects the arrest of christ where the soldiers take jesus into
            custody
            
            this scene is considered a second choice, could not be an altar
            piece.  The altar piece is almost always virgin and child

            duccio had much more freedom in this piece

        though this isn't a great show of 3d, compared to byzantine pieces
        there is a very obvious change in visual effect


    14-13 Martini
        from one ot the side altars in scienna

        tells the story of the arch angel gabrial to tell the virgin that she
        is going to give birth to christ

        this painter seems to be one of the main developers in the
        international gothic style in the late 13th early 14th century
            probably from artistic influences between italy and other parts of
            europe

            there are a number of artists that move to france after the pope
            moved there

    Allegory of good and bad government:
        adjacent to the city on the right that has the representation of the
        city sciena

        preents sciena on supporting the virtues of the wise and the good

        14-17:
            painting adjacent to allegory

            workers on the room, presents sciena as a prosperous city,
            economically active

            very much a promotion of sciena as a vibrant and well governed city

        14-18:
            view of the city walls of scienna.  Crops being planted, peasants
            working the field, people going to market

            this is all a portriat of scienna, which is not just the city but
            the entire region

            the angel in the uper left:
                this lady, the figure of justice.  THe idea being that justice
                rules scienna

                the hangman shows that the evil are puncished and the good can
                flourish

            Landscape imagrey was not common at this time.  There is not
            traddition of landscape painting in the middle ages that leads to
            this, likewise there is not much of this in the next few centeries
                later in the 16th century we start to see landscape pieces like
                this much more commonly



Late midieval and early renaissance:
    northern europe in the 14th-15th centuries

    although there is kind of a curious time lag with italy vs northern europe:
        in the last slide, italy started in the early 13th century.

        now we are starting around 1400 in northern europe
            though he says this is mostly arbitrary, he says that part of this
            is that there is a kind of progressive tendency that foreshadows
            the coming renisance developed earlier in italy.

    20-2:
        The well of moses, claus sluter

        Decoraded a well that was a source of water for a very famous chapel in
        djion, which was the capital of dutch burgendy (though it doesn't
        exist noww, it was very important at that time).  It was a very wealthy
        region that had alot of funding for art

        the sculpter was from the northern netherlands and came south to work
        for the dukes of burgondy.  He did alot of sculpture at this chapel
        (though this is the only one we are looking at).

        THe iconography of these figures:
            there was originally a scene of the cruxifix above this piece,
            though it was destroyed

        these figures were all originally painted

        different kind of realism, specific to northern european art:
            attention to every detail.  Wrinkles, stray hairs, folds in the
            cloth.
            
    20-17:
        illuminated manuscripts

        the book of hours, type of devotional text important in the middle ages
            this was meant for the common people. for them to keep at home and
            aid in devotion (with things like holidays)

            it was also a sort of display object, they were decorated very
            beautifully

            the common people wanted to mimic the richer folk

    20-15:
        the very rich hours of the duke of berry

        a very rpetty book of hours for this guy who was related to the frech
        kings and such, in charge of this place berry

        this one pecifically shows a banquet scene depicting the month of
        january


        this is the equivalent of the international style in italy
            a secular version of the same kind of thins.
            bright colors, gold leaf

        some of the images in the packet are those of the peasants though.  It
        alternates between scenes of the nobility and scenes of the peasant

            the peasants and the aristocrats are represented very differently.
                the rich are very colorful and nicely decorated and everything

                the peasant are always in a much more plain scene covered in
                snow or something

                the way the peasants bodies are represented seems to be more
                realistic as well

        it is speculated that some of the images were done by one of the
        brothers and the others were done by the others
            this might explain some of the stylistic differences

        there is a general pattern among these book of hours:
            the rich are represented in the international gothic style while
            the peasants are very plain

            displays the ambiance of the aristocracy


    the altar piece begins in italy and spreads elsewhere

    20-4:
        robert compain

        we see the patrons to the left, the angel and the virgin in the center
        and joseph on the right

        not a large painting, used to decorate some small chappel for the
        patrons to the left

        this scene is represented with a complete disregard for archelogically
        correct reconstruction of ancient palestine
            rather this painting depects the anunciation as if it were
            happening in a modern setting

        may be related to the culture of private devotion, pray to the saints
        at home and such

        the mousetrap:
            saint joseph is building mousetraps because of the relations to
            saint augustine where he talks about the crucifiction as a soft of
            mousetrap, the devil being caught in it

        running theme from this region and time:
            disguised or hidden symbols
            things have a dual function:
                the realism of the scene

                yet somethimes they also carry allegorical or symbolic
                information

                its hard to determine

    20-5:
        gendt altar piece:
            decorated for a family chapel at the church of saint john
            (dedicated to saint jogn the baptist) in the city of gendt

        the patrons are pictured on the altar piecee itself


        20-6:
            the interior of the painting, landscape again appears (though in a
            very speicific context).  Garden in paradise representing the image
            of the lamb with blood flowing out of its side


            the iconography is tied to some extent to saint john the evangalist
            who was considered the author of book of revelations as well as
            book of john
                he has a heavenly vision at the last of the book and this is
                depected at the bottom of the altar piece

    the realism of italy vs northern europe:
        northern europe is defeitely way closer attention to detail

    roger vanderviden:
        
        this painter was known very well for his depiction of human emotion:
            most notably the compassion of the virgin
                she swoons and suffers at the cruxifictoin

            in this one you have the hands of the virgin and jesus right next
            to eachotherm, to show the differences

        mary magdolin at the feet of christ

        this seemed to be similar to ancienct sculptures (even though yes this
        is a painting).  There is a sort of a theatrical presentation of the
        whole scene.

    we not switch to portriats

    20-8:
        most likely a self portriat

        portriature in the renessance is known as the new era with emphasis on
        the indeviduals

        there is a large debate of wether or not we should consider the 15th
        century as part of the renisance
            one of the main things for the renisance is the classical revival,
            this is not significant at this time

            though there are aspects of renisance, such as the modern realism

            one of the hallmarks is the importance of the status of the artist:
                if this is really a self portriat than this is sort of about
                his status, as he would create a portriat of himself

        there is the annalogy between the human and divine creation, due to van
        eyck's enscription:
            god made van eyck, but van eyck made this image

    20-7:
        double portriat of arlaphene and is wife, by van eyck

        this may be a record of a marriage seremony, there are many small hints
        that suggest this is a love thing

        there may be a reference to the theme of pregnancy, even if she is not
        really pregnant.  There is a saint in the back who is the saint of
        bearing child

        this is an oil painting, you can do much more detail with oil


early renaissance (15th century italy):
    meaning literally rebirth
        renaissance is a word that was used during the renaissance iself

    
    21-11:
        refernece to the classical antiquity.  Taken from obviouwsly the
        biblical story.

        he proudly is displaying his nakedness, sort of a display of power of
        the power of the figure

        he is also in a contra pasta stance, supposed to reference the ancient
        gods and such

    21-5:
        the itallian artist ismuch more interested in the structure of the body

        as well as the emotional state of the person

        the figure on horseback status is also a revival of the emporer on
        horse back

    21-27:
        portriature was a big thing in this period.

        The main thing in this painting is one such that it evokes a classical
        prototype, the sort of portriat where she is facing off to the side.

    21-17;
        the internatinoal style can be compared tot eh international gothic
        style

    21-18:
        mossacio

        emotional states are depicted strongly in the faces of the people in
        his paintings.

        painting is like poetry, a visual artist can represent images to form a
        story in the same way that a poet could tell a story with words

    21-20:
        geometry is the most important liberal art to a painter

        painting should be elevated in society rather than just some sort of
        trade

    21-1:
        pagon iconography
