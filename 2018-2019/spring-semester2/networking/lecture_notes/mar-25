- IP Fragmentation
    - routes overall are pretty stable
        - so if a datagram gets fragmented, it should be pretty much fragmented
          the same overall

    - fragments
        - keep track of their byte offset in the overall packet
        - keeps track of it if is the last fragment

        - so we know if a packet is fragmented
            - a packet won't be fragmented if it's byte offset is 0, and it is
              the last fragment

    - most packets are not fragments


    - size / header information
        - fragments will each have a header, of 20 bytes or something

        - each fragment has its ID (the same for all fragments, one per packet)

        - There is a bit that says if there is more or not

        - length of payload is a field

        - we know the start byte of this fragment
            - this has to be a multiple of 8 because we take 3 bits out for
              something else

    - arrival
        - they can arrive at the other end in any order

- IP Addressing
    - ipv4 addresses are 32 bit numbers

    - we write them as a base 256 number seperated by periods
        - this is called dotted decimal notation

    - every place connected to the internet must be able to speak ip
        - since they are logical and cahnge from one network to another

    - we group networks into subnets
        - a router has an associated ip address for each network it is involved
          with
            - each interface will have its own ip


    - switch
        - moves frames along within a local network

    - logic behind ip addresses and routing
        - the first n bits of the number identify the group
            - thi sis called the network number

        - the rest of the 32 - n bits are all identifiers for devices within
          that network
            - these are called the host numbers

        - so that means a network can have 2 ^ (32 - n) devices



    - clustering
        - we may want to make groupings within our addresses

        - you would assign the next m bits for the groupings
            - m = log base 2 (number groupings)

        - this is called subnetting
            - dividing your given addresses into further subnetworks


        - you have to tell people where this dividing line is!
            - this is given by a /number, which is an integer, between 1 and 30

            - this number is the number of bits that are reserved for the
              identification of the subnet

              - so for 192.168.0.0/24, the first 24 bits are for the subnet
                identification
                    - that is, '192.168.0'

    - Classles Inter-DOmain Routing
        - you can have a subnet of any length

        - you cannot tell by looking at an address what the address mask is


    - dhcp
        - send out a packet with all 1s that says, I need an IP

        - whoever responds to dhcp requests will see this

        - also ask for dns servers, domain search, proxy, ldap, router, etc
