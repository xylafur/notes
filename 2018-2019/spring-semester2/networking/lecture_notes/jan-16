- Much easier to remove noise from physical medium rather than radio waves
    - Though they don't always shield wire's properly and this can lead to some
      noise

    - People reserve frequencies for their company or whatever

- THe names of radio statios comes from regional:
    - W means america and K means west of the missisippi for instance

- the signal strength that people can broadcast at is also regulated
    - so people in neighboring regions can't broadcast in the same frequency
    - so radios in texas can bleed to mexico
        - this might piss them off and stuff

    - Pirate radio:
        - Super powerful radio station in mexico that broadcast a whole lot
            - way more powerful then they should have been able to


- Goals in chapter 1:
    - get a feel for termonoligy associated with the internet
    - the internet will be a main example, but we will use other types of
      networks as well


- What is the internet?
    - collection of networks whos users have agreed to conform to a set of
      standards

    - devices:
        - hosts:
            - devices on the edge of the system, end systems
            - servers, desktops, smart fridges, etc..
            - run network applications

            - they are able to connect to the internet because they have
              software that allows them to send packets on the network
                - we use sockets to communicate with packets on our computer
                    - sockets can send out packets (given particular
                      parameters) and can also recieve them (if they are
                      programmed to listen)

        - packet switches
            - recieve incoming packets (a particular data structure) and can
              determine the destination based on header information in the
              packet.
                - may not always be the best way to get to a particular host,
                  but they send it in the right directoin (though its not
                  always the fastest)

                - tries to make the best guess

            - commonly called routers
                - but switches are also a subclass of packet switches


        - communication links:
            - connects all of the end systems together

            - physical medium
                - or radio
                - but it is the actual transmission mediuim

            - speed of a network
                - we are not talking about how long it takes for something to
                  get from one end to the other
                    - regardless of how you encode data, nothing changes the
                      speed at which data travels through a medium

                    - everything travels at the speed of light

                - how to we measure speed then
                    - when you have the packet and you are ready to send it
                        - from the time you start sending the first, to the
                          time it takes to send the last bit
                            - we keep track of how many of these we can do a
                              second
                    - use the term bandwidth
                        - how quickly can you shit out all of these bits




    - Once we have communication links, and all of these devices
        - connecting them together and using the tcp/ip protocol makes them part
          of the internet

        - you can have devices interconnected, but not have them be part of the
          actual internet (lan)

        - we have protocols that define the rules or language on how to speak
          with other devices
            - there are rules about packet size and structure and stuff, but as
              long as all of these rules are met then something is considered
              valid from the protocol point of view and can communicate with
              other devices that also know how to use this protocol

            - the IETF gets together and drafts up a document for a new
              protocol
                - they pass judgment of it and wether or not it is considered
                  valid

                - you also get comments from other people
                    - they can give you their 2 cents

                - these documents specify very specifics about protocols
                    - parameters, needed functions, the format of timestamps
                        - every last thing that you need to conform with the
                          protocol completley

    - The internet society
        - when people agree that something is to be a standard, it is moved
          through a process, if it passes through this process then all devices
          on earth must conform to this
            - if they don't then they just won't be able to connect to the
              internet

    - The internet, a service view:
        - a programming interface to apps
            - just something that almost happens in the background.  Layers and
              layers of apis
                - because of these layers you don't have to know anything about
                  the specifics of how this communication happens

- The network edge
    - how to end systesms connect to routers that are on the closest edge?
        - government involvment
            - the same kind of infastructure used by telophone networks
                - access networks: veriety of technologies that take trafic and
                  get it all of a router that is connected to the internet,
                  communication through a provider of some sort

            - you have to go through these middle man
                - you can't lay your own cable
                - you can't lay your own sewer lines
                - you have to pay the company that procides this infastructure

            - there are government agencies that regulate these industries

    - Access network:
        - very often performance of a technology isn't what wins, its money,
          politics and religion

        - DSL:
            - this is a good example of the above statement:
                - we send voice over a phone line using as little frequency
                  range as possible (30Hz to 3000Hz or so)

                - since we used this range on our cables for phones they wanted
                  to use this for internet traffic as well
                    - they didn't want to deploy new technology to every single
                      house, rather they wanted to use existing infastructure

                - a modem splits up the upper range of frequencies into
                  different sections
                    - it then determins which of these are usable and which are
                      noisy and can't be used

                    - you use the sections that are avaliable for telephone
                      traffic.
                        - the upload and downlod is asymetrical though, have
                          more downstream than upstream

                        - this allowed for up to 20mbps down
                            - this required no new infastructure (other than
                              modems)
        - cable network
            - the cable companies did the same thing
                - they removed some tv stations and dedicated some of these not
                  to encode movie, but rather to encode data from the internet

            - the difference between this and the phone DSL connection
                - phone connections, there was one to each house
                - for cable, the stations were shared, since everyone was
                  getting the same data

                - this leads to problems with having to share bendwidth between
                  other users



        - fiber
