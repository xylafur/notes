- DNS
    - we can have mutliple strings that point to a particular ip

    - we cache recent dns lookups

    - to open a socket connection, we need an ip address
        - the application must look up the ip for the given hostname if the
          hostname is what was given

        - then after it gets the ip, it can do the socket call

        - we are able to do this because we are given the dns server ip off the
          bat
            - or we set it ourselves

            - we will talk about how we are given this later

    - we can often have an external and internal dns servers


    - before we ask the dns server for a given ip, we check our own internal
      cache
        - ips are given a validity time frame, if we check again for that
          hostname wthin that timeframe then we use our cache

        - this timer doesn't get reset when we acces the cache

    - DNS can be regional


    - TTL is how long the dns cache is valid for
        - the time limit on our cache

    - DNS records
        - A
            name: hostname

        - NS
            - name is domain

        - CNAME
            - an alias for some real name


    - DNS protocol
        - data structure with particular fields that we send out
        - there is a place in the daratructure to fill in the answer to our
          questions
            - so the dns server will send back a modified version of the packet
              we sent

    - Updating DNS
        - register a name with the dns registar



    - DNS attacks
        - sending a shit ton of fake dns requests to bog down the dns server




- P2P applications
    - so far we have only talked about client server architecture

    - drive telecommunication companies crazy
        - because they are setup to go in only a couple directions

    - the distribution time is completley based on the weakest link

    - max upload rate is based on the total number of uploaders


- Video streaming and CDN's
    - pretty much the #1 consumer of bandwidth

    - how they deal with the huge demans
        - distributed application infastructure around the world

    - one thing thats much different about delivering over the internet
        - don't want to use a fixed bandwidth all of the time

        - we only need to send things that change from one frame to the next

        - we might have a particular bandwidth budget
            - we want to send a packet after some particular time frame

            - some things change gradually, and this mechanism does not keep up
            - every down and then the entire frame will be retransmitted
