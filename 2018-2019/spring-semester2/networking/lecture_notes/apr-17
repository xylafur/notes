- Lan
    - A collection of devices that can see eachother

    - routers are not something that join computers together but rather
      something that can seperate two lans

    - You can only see things on your own lan
        - the router is the bridge between lans, and it needs to know how to
          see all of the LANs

- Virtual Lans
    - you can use switches to simulate people being on different lans
    - this means that not everyone can see everyone's broadcasts and stuff
        - you can only see those if you are on the correct lan

- Extent of Lan
    - Broadcast Range
        - if you broadcast out a message, who all would see it?  All the people
          that would see it are on your lan

- Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
    - Allows you to define people who are all on the same lan but are maybe on
      different sides of the world or something

    - this sits on top of certain speed point to point network

    - what it does
        - you define groups with a MPLS tag
        - you share this tag with your internet provider

        - Your internet provider will program this information into their
          switches

    - Implementation
        - you have all of your networks connect to switches in the MPLS cloud
        - then particlar end points on the other end of the MPLS cloud have a
          particular flag or identifier
            - the switches use this identifier to route things through the
              network to the correct endpoint based on this identifier


    - The MPLS identifier goes in layer 2
        - the header is inserted into the layer 2 packet, right after the
          ethernet header

    - MPLS capable routers
        - assign labels based on IP addresses
            - this has to be done because many 'clients' using the MPLS service
              might have the same IP addresses (because you just give them your
              local ip address


    - MPLS vs IP paths
        - with mpls you can add sophisticated rules over ip

        - you have mpls forwarding tables
            - very similar to the routing tables
            - you have in label, out label, destinatio and the interface that
              you send it out of


    - MPLS is just a delivery mechanism in layer 2

- Data Center Scale Networking
    - changes so quickly its crazy

    - can have hundres of thousands of individual addressable hosts
        - hosts doesn't always mean individual devices (virtual os)
        - but in our context we will assume it does


    - managing all these hosts
        -old way (isolation)
            - sandwich servers and data storage servers
            - connect them with a super high speed switch

            - when we began to use virtual machines and have everyone use them,
              this model blew up

        - heiarchy
            - a rack is connected to a switch
                - TOP OF RACK switch
            - this switch is connected to a higher level switch
                - TIER 1 Switch

            - this switch is connected to a load balancer and a router
                TIER 2 Switch

- Energy and Power Efficency
    - PUE
        - ratio of unit energy consumed and energy to power server


- A day in the life of a web request
    - our goal is to identify what happens when someone opens google.com on
      their laptop

    - what happens
        - you connect to a wifi network by listening for a beacon
        - then after connecting, first on layer one, then 2
        - you make a dhcp request
            - this heads over udp
            - this is a broadcast message, you just populate the source address
                - this packet goes out and then the dhcp server gets it

            - then the dhcp server will respond with an ip address that it took
              form its pool
                - the switch has been paying attention
                - the dhcp server responds with the host's new IP and alot more
                  information

        - now we have an ip address
            - we have to figure out the ip of the destinatin server

            - we have been given the name and ip address of our dns server, but
              we don't know the hardware address
                - we issue a request for the mac address of the dns server
                - ARP is used to request the hardware address of the dns server
                  thorugh a broadcast

                    - the router acts as a middle man, either because it is
                      running dns or because it is connected to another lan
                      that has the dns (or another one)

                    - then the router will give you his address to use

        - now we can send our dns request
            - our request goes to the router, the router drops it onto the next
              lan
            - this gets all the way to the dns server
        
        - We now have the ip address of the destinaion
            - we can now use a tcp connection that carries http

            - TCP has to do a handshake
                - it sends a SYN segment to the desination
                - the destionation ACKS back
                - then we ack back with data

        - TCP now carries our http address
            - the web server uses the correct socket to ensure that the packet
              ends up in the right location
