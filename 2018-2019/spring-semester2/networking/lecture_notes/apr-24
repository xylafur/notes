- Mobie IP
    - what is mobility?
        - mobile user who passes through multiple access points while maintainging
          ongoing connections

    - idea of a home netowkr
        - have a piece of software running on a router called a home agent

        - people continue to send packets to where they think you are
            - this router will intercept all of these packets

            - then when you get to your new location, the router will just forward all of
              your packets to your new location

    - important conceept: how can I move around without having to update everyone
        - this hides the fact that you moved

- Digital Transmission Fundamentals
    - we want to turns things into 1's and 0's, but those aren't our only options
        - we can instead incode things as words

        - we can send things in blocks, or streams

    - digitization of analog signal
        - we may just make an approximation
            - there is an international standard to rate an audio feed


        - bit rate of digitized signal
            - you can't send more bits than the bandwidth can handle

        - using digital allows us to regenerate a pristine copy of the sent signal
            - with analog, noise will be amplified


        - Digital Binary Signal
            - the signals need to be sharing their clock, but the clock will drift apart
              over time

            - pulse transmission rate
                - We want to send things in pulses so the receiver can actuall see when
                  things are supposed to be either 1's or 0's

                - the more narrow the pulse, the better

                - attinuation is dependent on frequency

            - multilevel pulse transmission
                - like QLC flash it seems, the magnitude of the pulse can take one of
                  many values

            - signal to Noise Ratio
                - the lower the signal strengh, the more noise will be able to influence
                  the result on the other side

            - Shannon Channel Capacity
                - based on the signal to noise ratio, you need to mitigate bandwidth on
                  the wire downward the larget the ratio is

                - you can take the average time the signal is above or below the line
                  over a period of time
                    - the longer the period of time the better our valid acceptance rate
                      will be

- Line COding
    - want to take serier of binary bits and encode them

    - there are different methods of encoding
        - we can make 0's be represented as negativ
        - 0's can be represented as 0

        - 1's can be positive going edges and 0's can be negative going edges

        - you can use modulation and such
            - 1's and 0's map to osscilating values

- Network Security
    - what does it mean to say network security?
        - confidentiality
            - only the sender and reveriver can read their message

        - authentication
            - sender and receiver are able to confirm the identity of each other

        - message integrity
            - receiver can ensure that it wasn't altered

        - access and avalibility
            - services must be accessible and avalible to users



    - Replay attack
        - listen to all packets going back and forth, then repeat what someone did when
          we started watching

        - can make the receiver do something twice
            - this is why we started with random sequence numbers
            - this would make the acks not have the right sequence number

    - What can a bad guy do?
        - impersonate
        - deny service
        - eavesdrop

        - and much much more!

    - Cryptograpgy
        - eliminated the requirement for two methods of communication
            - message and password

            - there used to be one time passwords for a day
                - this was given on a piece of paper
                - this is the other method of communication

        - Then in 1979 there was a paper published by 3 guys from MIT that created RSA
            - the world changed

        - RSA
            - uses a pair of keys
                - each person has a public and a private key

                - you use your private key to encrypt a message
                    - then that message can only be unencrypted with the public key

                    - this allows us to guarantee that a particular message came from a
                      particular person

                - you can encrypt something with a public key
                    - then only someone with the private key can unencrypt it

                    - this allows us to hide the true contents of a message

                - if you use both of these approaches we get what we were after!
                    - we can verify the receiver
                    - and we can ensure that noone can eavesdrop

        - DES
            - lots of rounds running data through an application
                - each round uses a very large encryption key
