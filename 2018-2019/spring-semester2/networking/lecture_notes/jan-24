- Cable network (continued)
    - very broad network, have the ability to easily divide those frequencies
      into multiple channels

        - some of these channels were used to transmit internet rather than tv

    - Access Network : home network
        - ISP -> modem -> router, firewall, NAT -> wireless access point

    - Enterprise access networks
        - ISP -> institutional router -> switch -> servers
                       \
                         -> Ethernet switch -> host systems

    - Wireless access networks
        - shared access network connects every end system to the router
        - wireless LANs
            - like ur home wifi
            - not restricted, in the public domain

        - wide-area wireless access
            - provided by cell towers


- Moving information
    - we take data and send it as packets

    - before packets we sent everything as a continuous stream of information
        - we are much more likeley to be able to pick out 1s and 0s if the
          signal is digital if the signal is noisey and full of a bunch of
          distrotion / noise
            - we can guess what something is if we know its either a 1 or 0
            - we can't really guess what something is if it is analog and could
              be anything

    - the wireless signal itself is signal, but we encode digital information
      on it

    - transmission time:
        - time it takes to transmit an entire packet
        - how long it takes the router to put all of the information onto the
          ethernet cable

    - propogation speed:
        - time that it takes for a bit to move through one router to another
        - how long our info travels through the thernet cable



- Physical media
    - guided media
        - things like wires
        - the signal strength is pretty good over longer distances - especially
          compared to radio

    - unguided media
        - signals propogate freely

        - radio
            - propogation issues
                - copies that make it from source to destination
                    - copies your signal from propogation will bounce off of
                      objects and hti the reciever at a later time


                - since the signal propagates in all directions
                - the signal strength when it reaches the tower is almost
                  nothing

                - then also reaching the tower is garbage on the same frequency


            - a trick to avoid the proogation issues is MiMo
                - multiple antaneas inside of the tower reciever broadcaster
                  that a user connects to

                - also multiple anteanas inside of the phone or whatever is
                  sending the signals




LECTURE 2 (SLIDESHOW 2)

- The network core
    - there are special areas on the internet where only routers are talking to
      each other
        - they just trade traffic

- Packet switching
    - we have a router in between the source and the destination

    - store and forward
        - the entire packet must arrive at a router before it can be
          transmitted on the next link

        - with packets we could send a single bit at a time, but that is not
          the store and forward model
            - this only works if you are the only one using the network

        - there is obviously going to be a delay as we wait for each router
          along the way to receive, process and then forward the packet to the
          next destination
            - depending on the network, different types of delay will be more
              prominant

- Two key network-core fucntions
    - routing
        - determines source destination route taken by packets

        - what decisions to teach the router to take.  If it comes from this
          port on this network, send out on this port

        - software that runs that tries to determine the best way

        - outputs a table

        - no router has a map of the internet, or knows the fastest way to any
          other link
            - make a good guess though

            - routers don't know the best entire way, they know the next step
              though

    - forwarding
        - move packets from one input to appropriate router output

    - circuit switching
        - sending bits at a time, not packets.  Connection from end to end
            - everybody gets the same signal, so send just one continuous
              stream

        - the internet only does packet switching, but we can do online radio
          and tv etc, tech that uses circut switching

        - we can sort of hack the internet and use circut switching on the
          packet network
            - packets are broken up into very small ones so that routers are
              more likely to have room for them
            - the internet doesn't treat these packets any differently though

- Internet structure
