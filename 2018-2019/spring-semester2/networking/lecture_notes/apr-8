- Network Manager
    - program that often uses snmp
        - you send a device a message, and generally a device knows how to run
          snmp
        - can be used for anything involved with managing networks or systems

    - snmp protocol
        - every device has to publish what things it can do
            - this is called a mib

        - a syntax for their commands

- Down another layer!

- Link / Data Link Layer
    - Ethernet is something that runs in this layer

- Since there is a huge variety of tings that can send bits
    - sent over glass or rf radiation or electrical over ethernet

    - thousands of types of these technologies

- Addresses
    - MAC addresses
- Termes
    - we have 'nodes' connected with 'links'
        - not super universally accepted

    - unit of information at layer 2 is called a frame

    (layer 3 is fragment, layer 4 is segment and layer 5 is message)

- there is a parcitular pattern of data that is reserved only for the beginning
  of a frame

  - differnt from the layers above bevause now we have to physically deal with
    connecting two devices together
        - lots of poeple canshare the medium, but we have to get one source to
          one destination



- Error correction and Detection
    - you need to know how 


- Sharing
    - if its shared, you have to check if anyone else is using it


- flow control
    - at what pace can we get away with sending frames to devies at the other
      end?

    - half or full deplex?

- where is it implemented?
    - at the end of every connection
    - every ether net or cable or whatever is physically connected

    - if you have wifi and ethernet you have 2 different link layer
      implementations


- communication
    - data link frames have both headers and tails

    - the error correction stuff is in the tail not the head

- Error Detection
    - in nutsheel - sending extra data

    - just tells you if there was an error or not
    - does not have the abiliy to fix

    - all error detection algorithms have some probability of returning a false
      negative
        - they will say that there was no error when there really was


- parity checking
    - 

- error correction
    - one way to think about combination of bits, is to consider them dots in
      space

    - cyclic redundancy check
        - very complicated, but effective

        - used in networks that is higly prone to errors
        - where it needs to be detected at every link
