- Markup / webpages
    - Originally the server had the html file and sends it to the client

    - nowadays systems create information on the fly and convert it to html and
      then send it to the client
        - he's talking about like templating and using stuff from data from a
          database or something

        - some of the stuff is static, but alot of it is dynamically created
          based on stuff from the database

- HTTP
    - the transport protocol
        - caries the html from the server to the client

    - uses tcp
        - high value transport
        - delivers in order

    - is stateless
        - keeps no record of your info or whats going on.  Just routes

    - stateless prototocol

    - the browser handles the http messages and then renders the html

    - types of connections
        - non-persistent connection
            - shuts the conection after each object is recieved

        - persistent connection

    - request message:
        - GET
            - asking for a file
            - specifies the version of HTTP

        - POST
            - usually when the user hits a button or enters input

            - the input is generally sent with the request

        - multiple header lines
            - some are optional
            - they have the format
                - <key> : <value>

    - faking states
        - the programs have to do it!

        - since http is stateless we can do a sort of hack to include
          infromation like variables or just other info

        - URL
            - we can include information in the url, seperated by special
              characters like &

        - cookies
            - information that you permit to be stored on your harddrive

- Web caches (proxy server)
    - servers that keep copy of things requested often
        - put copies of objects close to the end user

    - The goal is to lower the average response time

    - good for server owners
        - good for distributing traffic
