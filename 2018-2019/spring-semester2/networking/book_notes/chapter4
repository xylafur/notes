Chapter 4 - The Network Layer: Data Plane

    - the network layer can be broken into two parts, the control plane and the data
      plane

    4.1 Overview of the Network Layer
        - the data plane roll of each router is to forward datagrams from its input links
          to its output links
        - the primary role of the control plane of each router is to get those packets to
          their destination, end to end

        4.1.1 Forwarding and Routing: The Data and Control Planes
            - the goal is to move things from origin to destination

            - forwarding
                - when a packet arrives at a router's input link, it must go ut of the
                  correct output link
                    - additionally the packet mught just be blocked

                - very very fast, implemented in hardware

                - forwarding table
                    - uses header info of a packet to index a table and this tells the
                      router which output interface to use

            - routing
                - the network layer must determine the route or path taken by packets as
                  they flow

            - control plane: the traditional approache
                - routers talk to eachother to figure out who can get to a particular
                  destination

            - control plane: the SDN approach
                - SDN == Software Defined Networking

                - there is some remote controller that computes and distributes the
                  forwarding tables to be used

                - the routing device only does forwarding in this case, routing is
                  offloaded.

        4.1.2 Network Service Model:
            - NSM defines characteristics of end-to-end delivery of packets

            - possible services include
                - guaranteed delivery
                - guaranteed delivery with bounded delay
                - in order packet delivery
                - guaranteed minimal bandwidth
                - security

            - the internet network layer only actually provides one service
                - best effort service
                    - none of the things we just listed that the network layer could do

4.2 What's Inside a Router?
    - A router has
        - input ports
            - physical layer function of terminating an incoming physical link at a
              router

            - performs link layer functinos needed to interperate witht he link layer at
              the other side of the incoming link

            - a lookup function is performed
                - forwarding table is consulted

                - control packets are forwarded to the routing processor

        - switching fabric
            - connects input ports to output ports
            - completley contained within the router

        - output ports
            - stores packets received from the switching fabric and transmits them onto
              the outgoing links by performing link and physical layer functions

        - Routing Processor
            - performs control plane functions

            - either does routing algorithm or talks to the remote controller and
              installs entries

        - all of this is implemented in hardware

    - types of forwarding
        - destination based forwarding
            - get pointed towards the final destination

        - generalized forwarding
            - forwarded absed on some other factors within the packet

    4.2.1 Input Port Processing and Destination Based Forwarding
        - Forwarding Tables
            - Implemented by assigninging a Particular sequential range of ip addresses
              to a particular output port

            - if the destination address matches more than one entry, the longest one is
              chosen

        - After the output port has been decided, the packet is sent to a particular
          output port
            - in some designs if the switching fabric is busy, packets cannot be sent
              through

        - particular fields in the packet must be updated
            - time to live
            - version number
            - checksum

    4.2.2 Switching
        - The fabric is what does all of the switching (forwarding) for a router

        - switching via memory
            - how they did it originally
            - routing signal triggered an interrupt in the processor
                - packet was then vopied form the input port into memory
                - then the processor extracted the destiation address, and looked this up
                  in the table
                - then it wrote the packet to the correct output port

            - there are still some swiches around that do it shi way today

        - swithching via a bus
            - an input port transfers a packet directly to the output port over a shared
              bus

            - since buses can only pass one thing at a time, this can only handle
              switching one packet at a time

            - fast enough for most small applications

        - switching via an interconnection network
            - a crossbar switch is an interconnection network consisting of 2N buses that
              connct N input ports to N output ports

            - each vertical bus intersects each horizontal bus at a crosspoint
                - basically you can open and close connections

            - have to wait for the same output port

    4.2.3 Output Port Processing
        - takes packets that have been stored in the output port's memory and transmits
          them over the output link

    4.2.4 Where Does Queueing Occur?
        - Input Queueing
            - switch fabric is not fast enough (relative to input speeds) to transfer all
              arriving packets through the fabric without delay

        - Output QUeueing
            - if everybody wants to go out the same port then the queue will start to
              stack up no matter how fast your switching fabric is


            - we can decide to either drop the arriving packet or one or more of the
              already queued packets
            - there are a number of proactive packet-dropping and marking policies known
              as "Active Queue Managment"
                - one of the most widley used it "Random Early Detection"

    4.2.5 Packet Scheduling
        - First in First out
            - selects packets for link transmission in the same order in which they
              arrived

        - Priority Queueing
            - Packets arriving at the output link are classified into priority classes
              upon arrival at the queue

            - packets are served based on this priority class.  The higher the priority
              the sooner they are handled
                - if there are multiple packets of the same priority, then they are
                  handled in a FIFO fashion


        - Round Robin and Weighted Fair Queueing (WFQ)
            - packets are divided into classes, then a packet is handled from each of
              those classes fairly

            - work conserving queueing discipline will never allow the link to remain
              idle whenever there are packets of any class queued for transmission

            - weighted fair queuing discipline
                - arriving packets are classified and queued in the appropriate per class
                  waiting area

                - serves classes in a circular manner
                    - if one of the classes is empty, it moves on to the next

                - each class can be given a weight
                    - the higher the weight, the more overall time that class will be
                      given for transmission

                    - there is a guaranteed throughput then of

                        R * wi / W

                        - where
                            R is the transmission rate
                            wi is the weight of a particular class
                            W is the sum of all weights


4.3 The Internet Protocol: IPv4 Addressing and more
    - 4.3.1 IPv4 Datagram Format
        - network layer packet is called a datagram

        - IPV4 packet
            - version number
            - header length
            - type of service
                - what is using this ip datagram?
                - can program to behave differently if its for something like
                  live voice or a video game

            - identifier, flags, fragmentation offset
                - ip fragmentation

            - datagram length
                - total length of the ip datagram plus the header size, in bytes

            - identifier, flags and fragmentation offset

            - time to live
                - ensure datagrams do not circulte forever

            - protocol
                - used when the datagram reaches its final destination.
                  Indicates the specific TL progocol that data portion of the
                  datagram should be passed to

                - similar to the port number of a layer 2 transport segment

            - header checksum
                - checksum is only over the header of the ip datagram

            - source and destination ip addresses

            - options
                - allow the ip header to be extended

            - data

    - 4.3.2 IPv4 Datagram Fragmentation
        - not all link layer procols carry data of the same size

        - if (as a router) you have to send a datagram to an outgoing link that
          has a smaller MTU (maximum transmission unit) you will have to break
          it up into chunks

        - fragments can be reassembled before they reach the transport layer of
          the destination
            - fragments are reassembled at end systems, NOT network routers

        - fragments keep track of their identification, number in the fragment
          and so forth

        - the last fragment has a flag bit set to 0, all other fragments have
          it set to a 1
            - this is because ip is unreliable data transfer


    - 4.3.3 IPv4 addressing

    - 4.3.4 Network Address Translation
        - every ip capable device needs an ip address
            - to avoid needing an internet ip for each device, network address
              translation

        - the ip addreses we use in our local networks will not be
          understandable to other people

        - a NAT enabled router does not look like a router to the outside world
            - it looks like a single device with a single ip address

            - the router gets its ip address via dhcp
                - the ISPs dhcp

        - NAT translation table
            - the NAT router has a table that includes the port numbers as well
              as ip addresses

            - when a user requests something beyond the nat router, it keeps
              track of the destination / source port as well as destination /
              source ip of the request.
                - it uses an arbitrary outgoing port to connect to the end
                  system

                - all of this is the NAT table to help the router find who owns
                  the packet that just got delivered back

        - downfalls of nat
            - port addresses are meant to be used for addresing processes, not
              for addresing hosts
                - this can cause problems for servers running on the home
                  netowrk
