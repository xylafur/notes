- 1.1 What is the internet?
    - We will answer this in terms of hardware and netowrk infastructure

    - Nuts and Bolts
        - computer network that connects a bunch of different devices

        - Things that connect to the internet are called 'end systems'
            - these end systems are connected together by a network of
              "communication links" and "packet switches"

            - communication links are the physicsal connection

        - Information is slapped with headers and footers for each segment -
          these things are called packets

            - these packets are reassembled on the end system

        - Packet switches take packets arriving through one of its
          communication links and forwards the poacked to an outgoing
          communication link
            - there are 2 main types of packet switches
                - routers
                    - typically used in the network core

                - link-layer switches
                    - - typically used as the network core

            - the patch traversed by these packets is known as the route

        - end systems access the internet thorugh Internet service providers
            - lower tier ISPs are interconnected through international
              upper-tier ISPs (such as AT&T, Sprint, etc..)


        - End system, switches and other pieces on the internet run protocols
            - Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP)
              are two of the most important protocols in the Internet
                - IP:
                    - the format of the packets sent
                - Known as TCP/IP

            - The IETF (Internet Engeinnering Task Force) Creates these
              protocols
                - people who work on infastructure must follow them



    - Services Description
        - the internet can be viewed as an infastructure that procides services to
          applications

        - distributed applications involve multiple end systems that exchange data
          with one another
            - these applications do not run in the packet switches

        - End systems attached to the internet procide a socket interface that
          specifices how a program running on one end system asks the internet
          inrastructure to deliver data to a specific destination program running
          on  another end system

            - this socket interface is simmilar to the need to write teh sending
              address and name of the person you want to send a snail mail letter
              to

        - for protocols
            - there are specific messages that we send
            - and specifiic actions we take in response the the received reply
              (including no reply)

            - entities must use these same protocols to really communicate

        - Network Protocols
            - All activity in the Internet that involves two or more communicating
              remote entities is governed by a protocol.


- 1.2 The Network Edge
    - This is more about the components of a computer network (and the internet
      in particular)

      - Hosts are divided into
        - Clients
        - Servers

        - we say that hosts are at the "edge of the network" since they are the
          end user

    - Access Networks
        - two types of broadband
            - DSL (digital subscriber line):
                - over a telophone line

                - 3 different frequency ranges are used to allow for regular
                  telophone calls, upload and download

            - Cable
                - fiber optic cable connects neighborhood level junctions to
                  cable head end (CMTS) (the ISP I guess?)
                    - the CMTS converts analog signal sent from the cable
                      modems to digital format

                    - cable is divided into two channels, a downstream and an
                      upstream

                - Everyone gets everybodys packets
                    - we are all sharing the same cable
                    - if a bunch of people are using the internet in your area
                      it will slow down for everyone

            - Fiber to the Home
                - a strand of fiber goes from the ISP to the neighborhood
                  splitter

                - two methods of splitting
                    - Active OPtical Networks
                        - essentially switched ethernet

                    - Passive Optical Networks
                        - each home has an optical network terminator


                - these junctions then connect to individual houses with cable
                  wire




    - Access in the Enterprise (and the home): Ethernet and wifi
        - in many networks lan is used to connect an end sstem to the edge
          router

    - Physical Media

        - HFC : mix of fiber and cable tech like we have in most homes
        - Can be fiber, copper, radio waves, etc

        - Guided Media
            - guided along a solid medium (fiber, cable)
        - Unguided Media
            - wave propogates in teh atmosphere and outerspace

- 1.3: The Network Core
    - Packet Switching
        - Networked systemes exchenge messages
            - these messages are divided into packets
            - the packets are sent to their destination through a series of
              packet switches

        - Store and Forward Transmission
            - how most packet switches handle input
            - the packet switch must receive the entire packet before it can
              begin to transmit the first bit of the packet to the outbound
              link

            - the delay for each packet to reach its destination caused by
              routers it equal to

              d(n): (n+1)*L*R
                where n is the number or routers, L is the number of bits to
                send and R is the bit/sec rate

        - Queuing Delays and Packet Loss:
            - each output from a packet switch has its own output buffer
                - if the buffer is full when a new packet arrives to be
                  transmitted on that link, the packet is lost

        - Forwarding Tables and Routing Protocols
            - The destination of a packet is written in its header

            - each router has a forwarding table
                - this table maps destination addresses (or portions of
                  addresses) to the router's outbound links

                - when a router recieves a packet, it reads the packets
                  destination address and then forwards it to the next router
                  based on its routing table

            - how do these tables get set?
                - there are a number of special routing protocols that are used
                  to automatically set routing tables

    - Circut Switching:
        - 2 fundamental approaches to moving data through a network
            - circut switching
            - packet switching

        - resources are reserved for the duration of the communication session
          between end systems
            - in a packet switched network these things are not reserved

        - this is what is used on telophone networks.
            - you have to wait for someone to answer the phone
            - when they do the two of you have a dedicated link

            - the two parties get a dedicated transmission rate for the
              duration of the connection

        - Multiplexing in Circut-Switched Networks
            - a circut is implemented with either
                - frequency-division multiplexing
                    - the frequency spectrum of a link is divided up among the
                      connections actoss the link

                    - like in a teleophone network

                    - the width of the band is called the bandwidth

                - time-division multiplexing
                    - time is divided into frames of fixed duration, and each
                      frame is divided into a fixed number of time slots

                        - one time slot from each frame is dedicated to a
                          particular user

                        - so the frames are shared between a number of users
                          equal to the number of slots

        - Packet Switching Versus Circut Switching
            - With circut switching, users are often idle and just sasting
              their time slots
                - this means that no one is able to connect using that time
                  slot still though

            - if someone has a very large file to send or recieve and there
              isn't much activity on the network then packet switching is
              definitely better
                - they get much greater bandwidth than they would with a time
                  slice


    - A Network of Networks
        - Individual ISPs connecting to one another

        - One global ISP will act as a provider, connecting many smaller ISPs
          known as customers

            ** This is called Network Structure 1 **

            - additionally there are multiple global ISPs that are themselves
              interconnected

                - since many smaller isps may be connected to one global ISP
                  but not the other, and vice versa, the global ISPs MUST be
                  interconnected


                ** WIth the above addition, this is: Network Structure 2 **


            - in practice this is even more leveled
                - there are Regional ISPs that handle connecting to access
                  ISPs

                - these regional ISPs have to get their connection from a
                  Global ISP

                - there be further even subsets in some places

                ** Network structure 3 **

        - There are also PoPs in the real world
            - A PoP is a group of one or more routers int he same location of a
              prociders network where a customer ISP can connect to the
              provider ISP

        - Access, regional or even Global ISPs can peer with one another
            - peering happens between ISPs in the same level

            - if two networks are peering then they are connected directly so
              that traffic between them connects directly

            - there can be a peer hub known as an Internet Exchange Point (IXP)

        ** All of this together is known as Network Structure 4 **


        ** Network Structure 5 is detailed below **
            - We add in "content-provider networks"

                - google is a leading example
                    - they have massive data centers all around the world
                      interconnected on their own private network

                    - it attemps to do this by avoiding all upper level global
                      ISPs by peering from access network to access network

- 1.4: Delay, Loss and Throughput in Packet-Switched Networks
    - We leave in the real world and sometimes packets are lost.
        - computer networks try to maximize throughput

    - Overview of Delay
        - There are several types of delays at each node along the path from
          server to host
            - total nodal delay:
                - What it sounds like, combination of all delays while packets
                  travel through nodes

            - nodal processing delay
                - the time required for a router to analyze the packets header
                  and figuring out where to direct it

                - can also include time needed to check for errors

                - usually in the order of microseconds

            - Queuing Delay
                - while the packet is in a router's queue

                - depends on how many packets are already in the queue

                - can usually be from microseconds to milliseconds

            - Transmission Delay:
                - We assume packets are served FIFO

                - The amount of time required to push all of the packet's bits
                  into the link

            - Propagation Delay
                - The time needed for a packet to propogate from the output of
                  router A to the input of router B
                    - the packet itself will propogate at the specific medium's
                      propogation speed

                    - ranging from 2 * 10^8 m/s to 3 * 10^8  m/s

                - The propogation delay will obviously be d / v
                    - there is a propogation delay between every router

            - Transmission vs Propogatoin Delay
                - Transmission Delay is amount of time required for the router
                  to push the packet out
                    - a function of thepacket's length and the transmission
                      rate of the link

                    - Has nothing to do with the distance between two links

                - Propogation delay is the amount of time it takes from a
                  packet to go through the ethernet cable (or whatever medium)
                  from one end to the other
                    - this has nothing to do with the size/ length of the
                      packet, only the distance between two routers and the
                      medium used

            - Again, the total nodal delay is the sum of all of these delays

    - Queuing Delay and Packet loss
        - Queuing Delay is the only type of those mentioned that can vary from
          packet to packet

            - because of this we ususally use statistics to meature it

        - It is measured using something called "Traffic intensity"
            - Traffic Intensity = L * a / R
                - L = bits ina packet = bits / packet
                - a = packet arival rate = packets / sec
                - R = transmission rate = bits / sec

            - if La/R > 1 then bits are ariving faster than they can be
              transmitted from the queue

                - the queue will increase in size continually and the queue
                  will reach infinite size

                - because of this, you want to design your system such that
                  traffic intensity is no greater than 1

            - If La/R < 1
                - If packets arrive periodically there will be no delay

                - if packets arrive in bursts, there will be no delay for the
                  first and a significant delay for the last

        - Packet loss;
            - in real life, queues are not infinite

            - if the queue is full when a packet arrives, the packet will be
              dropped

    - End to End Delay:
        - Now we consider delay with all of the nodes a packet must pass through

        - We have all of the types of the delays considered so far happening at
          each router.  So we sum each of these delays for each of the routers

    - Throughput on computer networks
        - throughput is the rate at any time at which data for a file is
          recieved

            - the average rate at which the data is being recieved for a
              specific application

        - the throughput will be the transmission rate of the bottleneck link

        - if multiple devices are sharing a common link, then that link may
          very well become the slowing factor for throughput
            - if there are 10 server client pairs that all operate at 1Mbps and
              then they all share a link that is 5Mbps, the total throughput to
              each server client pair will be .5Mbps

- 1.5 Protocol Layers and Their Service Models
    - Layered Architecture
        - Layers allow us to seperate components of a complex whole into
          simpler parts

        - also, if a layer has some given functionality, the layers above and
          below it know how to use this fucntionality

        - this also allows the implementation of a layer to change, as long as
          it retains the same functionaity

    - Protocol Layering
        - Network hardware and protocols are organized in layers

        - we are interested in the service model of a layer
            - the services that a layer offers to the layer above

        - a protocol layer can be implemented in software, hardware or a
          combination of the two

        - drawbacks of layerign
            - multiple layers might implement the same fucntionlity
                - for example all layers do error checking

            - an upper layer might need access to information that only a layer
              below it contains

        - the layers taken together are called the protocol stack
            - the internet protocol stack consists of 5 layers
                1 - physical
                2 - link
                3 - network
                4 - transport
                5 - application layers

            - Application Layer
                - where network applications and their application-layer protocols
                  reside

                - distributed over multiple end systems

                - a packet of information in the application layer is called a
                  message

            - Transport Layer
                - transports application layer messages between application
                  endpoints

                - two transport protocols
                    - TCP
                        - Connection oriented service
                        - guaranteed delivery of application layer messages
                        - flow control, sender reciever speed matching

                        - breaks long messages up into shorter segments
                            - this is done as a congestion control mechanism

                    - UDP
                        - connectionless service to its applications
                        - provides no reliability
                        - no flow control
                        - no congestion control

                - a packet in the transport layer is refered to as a segment

            - Network Layer
                - Responsible for moving network layer packets known as datagrams
                  from one host to another

                - provides the service of delivering the segment to the transport
                  layer in the destination host

                - includes the IP protocol
                    - defines the fields in the datagram

                - also contains routing protocols
                    - determine the routs that datagrams take between sources and
                      destinations

                - often refered to as the IP layer

            - Link Layer
                - Moves a packer from one node to the next node
                    - moves datagrams from the Network layer to the next host and
                      then passes that to the Network layer

                - Services provided depend on the specific link layer protocol
                    - some offer reliable delievery

                - Examples
                    - ethernet
                    - wifi
                    - cable access
                    - PPP

                - Packets in this layer are called frames

            - Physical Layer
                - moves individual bits within a fram from one node to the next

                - different for the physical connection type





        - OSI Model
            - Another protocol stack
            - has two extra layers

    - Encapsulation
        - Link layer switches only implement layers 1 and 2
        - Routers only implement layers 1, 2 and 3

        - when we package an application layer into a Transport layer, all of
          the data of the application layer packet is encapselated in the send
          transport layer packet
