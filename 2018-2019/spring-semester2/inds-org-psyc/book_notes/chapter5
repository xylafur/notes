Ideas:
    - App that takes in a song and spits out sheet music or tabs or something

    - app that takes in a song and spits out all the different instruments as
      different tracks

    - app that takes in a single instrument track and spits out the sheet music

    the last two could be used together to create the first one


    - app that takes in a single track and will add accompnyment
        - based on the chords can create a bassline
        - figure out temp and it makes a drum track
        - could add harmony to vocal tracks based on chords

Assesment Methods for Selection and Placement
    - This chapter is all about how to select people for a job

    - we will cover 5 techniques that cover various ways to realize the skills
      and characteristics needed for a job as well as checking applicants for
      those skills and characteristics


Job Related Characteristics
    - Many different KSAO's are needed for a job
        - kowledge: what a poerson knows about the job
        - skills: what a person is able to do
        - ability: capability to learn comething



    - to identify what is needed for a job, we do a job analysis

Psychological Tests:
    - standardized series of problems or questions thjat assess a particular
      individual characteristic

    - people don't always read the whole question, so we need many questions to
      ensure reliability and validity

    - Characteristics of Tests
        - We have both group and individual tests
            - usually in either case there is a test administrator

        - closed vs open ended test
            - close ended = multiple choice
                - preferred because ease in scoring

        - Tests can either be written (including keyboard and mouse) or
          performance tests where the indivdual has to manipulate apparatuses
          or actually do something

        - power tests vs speed tests
            - power: test taker gets unlimited time
            - speed test: time limit

                - designed so that most people can't finish in the given time

    - Ability Tests
        - ensures that a person has a capability to do some tast, either
          cognative or physical

        - Cognitive Ability Tests
            - valid predictors of job performance across many types of jobs
            - can be verbal or non verbal, for people who don't speak the
              language well

        - Psychomotor Ability Tests
            - test things such as abillity to manipulate objects or use tools

    - Knowledge and Skill Tests
        - designed to access a person's present level of proficiency

    - Personality Tests
        - used alot to acess aspects of peoples behavior in organizations

        - two major concerns
            - possiblity that applicants fake responses
            - personality tests are not always as relevant as other assessment
              devices

    - Emotional Intelligence Tests
        - falls between a personality trait and Cognitive ability

        - people's ability to control and recognize emotions

        - two types of EI assessments
            - trait: tests a person's awareness
            - ability:

        - can predict job performance

    - Integrity Tests
        - predict whether or not an employee will engage in counterproductive
          or dishonest behavior on the job

        - two types
            - overt:
                - assesses a person's attitudes and prior behavior

            - personality
                - personality characteristics that have been found to predict
                  overall counterproductive behavior


    - Vocational Intrest Test
        - matches either the interests or the personality of the test taker to
          those of people in a variety of different occupations

        - help to match people with the right job based on their interests


Other forms of Testing
    - tests that do not rely on the responses of individuals


    - credit checking
        - check information about debt, credit, loans, etc

    - drug testing

Biographical Information
    - asks alot of detailed background info about a person

    - a criticism is that questions are chosen based on if they are able to be
      predict performance rather than link to specific job requirements


Interviews
    - two types
        - unstructered
            - interviewer asks whatever comes to their mind
            - like a convo

        - structured
            - planned series of questions

    - structured are better for predicting job performance
        - multiple interviers are less likeley to agree with unstructured
          interviews

        - there are biases that can effect the results of an interview like how
          attractive the interviewer thinks the interviewee is

Work Samples
    - an assessment device that requires a person to demonstrate how well he or
      she can performe the tasks involved in a job

    - designed to measure performance in a higher level skill


Assessment Centers
    - How well a person is able to perform some of the tasks of a specific job
        - several exercises that simulate job tasks

    - in basket execrise
        - simulation that asks the assessee to pretend it is their first day on
          a new job

    - leaderless group exercise
        - several assignees are given a problem to solve together


    - scores from the assessment centers correlate with job performance

Electronic Assessment
    - Electronic Administration of Psychological Tests
        - Widely used and have the obvious advantages

        - disadvantages
            - might not be as cost effective because of time and money to
              develop software

            - not always == printed tests
                - speed tests aren't as relevant (not sure why though, they
                  produce different outputs?)


    - Computer Adaptive Testing
        - flexible computerized approach to item administration

        - the more correct you get in a row, the harder the questions get
        - if a wrong answer is chosen, the next question is easier


Summary
    - We want to access people's KSAO's for a particular job
