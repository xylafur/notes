- A way to describe a job and the skills needed for it
    - a method to describe jobs and tha attributes needed

- Two Categories
    - 1: Job Oriented
        - focuses on tasks done in the Job

    - 2: Person Oriented
        - focuses on the personal characteristics needed for a job

- What is job analysis?
    - 3 elements
        - 1: Must be systematic
        - 2: Aspects of the job are broken into units
        - 3: Must be a written report

- Job Oriented Approach
    - either describing the task or the characteristics of it

    - We can break actions down into smaller actions (p. 54)
        - position
        - duty
        - task
        - activity
        - element

- Person Oriented approach
    - characteristics of KSAO's neccessary of a person for a job
    - KSAO
        - knowledge
        - skill
        - ability
        - other characteristics

- Purposes
    - Career Development
        - rewarding employees for having the knowledge and skills by allowing
          them to climb the career ladder
        - employees know exactly the K and S they need to succeed

    - Legal Issues
        - define essential functinos and choose employees based on those
          function
        - if done propley, should save a company from disability disputes
        - if a person need to lift weight high above their head, then the
          company would not hire people in wheel chairs
            - without such a requirement, not hiring someone because they are
              in a wheel chair would be illegal

    - Performance Apprasal
        - determine major components of job performance
        - use critical incidents to highlight what is needed
            - critical incidents are just moments within the job that highlight
              really good or really bad performance
            - like this is an example of what you should be able to do and this
              is an example of what you should never ever do

    - Selection
        - once we know KSAOs we know what is required for a job
        - can choose employees that fit

    - Training
        - KSAO areas an employee is weak in can be trained upon
        - myust know what attributes are trainable and what aren't

    - Vocational Counceling
        - Determine a person's KSAOs and then match them w/ a job that requires
          that

- How Job Analysis is Collected
    - ask specialists
        - managers
        - supervisors
    - observe workers
    - do the job
    - questionare for the employees

- Methods
    - Job components Inventory
        - analyze job requirements and persons KSAOs at the same time
            - then we determine if a person is a good fit for the job

        - Job Features
            - what does a person need for this job?  What kinds of things will
              the person be doing?

            - using tools, perceptual and physical requirements, math,
              communication and decision making

    - O*NET
        - computer based resource for grouips of jobs having common
          characteristics

    - Position Analysis Questionare
        - Analyze jobs
        - Common elements that allof for comparissons of different jobs with
          similar dimensions of KSAOs
        - 6 categories

        - Mainly KSAO requirements
        - ranking KSAOs with that is more or less important

    - Task Inventory
        - List of specific tasks that might be done at job being analyzed
        - job incumbents rank their own job


- Choosing one of these job analysis methods
    - some are better for specific things

    - usually a mix of things


- Validity
    - Validity is best coming from comparing different methods of obtaining
      information
        - what the supervisors said vs what the incumbents said

    - people are more accurate when rating a very specific task

- Job Evaluation
    - Family of quantitative techniques that are used to determine the salary
      levels of jobs

        - job analysis methods are sometimes used
        - mathematically combine job information to determine a salary

    - Point Method
        - managers or other organization members determine the compensable
          factors for th ejob
            - Consequences of error on the job
            - reponsibility
            - education required
            - skill requried

        - Then a panel of new people judge the degres which each job has these
          factors

        - assign points to these factors
            - then sum them up and the salary is based on the total points

            - plot existing salarys against the point score for that job to
              determine what the salary should be for a particular point number

    - Comparable Worth
        - womens salarys are on average lower than mens

        - different but comparable jobs should get the same salary
