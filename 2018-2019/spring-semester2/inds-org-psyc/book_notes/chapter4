Performance Appraisal
    - appraising someone is best when comparing their work against some
      standards
        - before we can appraise we must know what good performance is

- Why do we appraise employees?
    - performance data can be used for

    - Administrative Decisions
        - can be used to fire workers that are bad
        - give raises to good employees
            - implement a merit pay system
        - laws in US gov't positions are based on job performance

    - Employee Development and Feedback
        - to imporove and maintain performance, employees need feedback

        - lots of companies now have feedback meetings with workers
            - not for pay raises or demotions or whatever, just to let them
              know what they need

        - research
            - mostly for improving employee job performance

- Performance Criteria
    - a definition of what we will judge performance on, what is good and what
      is bad

    - characteristics of Criteria
        - actual vs theoretical criterion
            - theoretical:
                - the idea of what good performance is

            - actual:
                - the way in which the theoretical criterion is assessed or
                  operationalized

                - actual performance appraisal technique

        - THe theoretical is what we actually care about, but the actual is
          what we actually get
            - actual can be prone to bias

            - contamination
                - a criterion that reflects something other than what it was
                  designed to measure

                - biases cause us to measure what people think and not the
                  thing we were trying to measure

            - deficiency
                - the criterion does not adequately cover the entire
                  theoretical
                - the actual is incomplete

            - relevance
                - actual citerions accesses theoretical

            - relevace is what we want, it is somewhere between deficency and
              contamination


    - Criterion Complexity
        - jobs involve multiple tasks that can all be evaluated from different
          perspectives

        - some criterion are quality based, other quality based
            - quality of a teaching vs quantity of total sales

        - composite scores are used to evaluate performance
            - we composite the socres from many specific criterion
            - but the individual socres on each of these are more important to
              an individual worker trying to imporove

    - Dynamic Ccriteria
        - variablitiy of performance over time
            - shism among IO, some thing performace is static others think not

        - sometimes best performance at one time do not remain the best

    - Contextual performance
        - extra voluntary things the workers do to help the company

- Methods for Assessing Job Performance
    - 2 categories

    - Objective Measures
        - things like sick days taken, number of trackers closed, etc

        - easy to interpret data

        - not applicable for jobs that do not have countable output

        - measures quantity not quality

    - Subjective Mesaures
        - someone like a supervisor rates an employee on various factors

        - gtaphic rating forms
            - multiple dimensions are given with multiple possible values for
              each dimension

        - Behaviour focused rating forms
            - rate an indivisuals behavior in particular areas

            - Behavioraly Anchored Rating Scale
                - assign particular values to particular points on a numerical
                  scale

                - 10 is: follows the course syllabus, presents lecrues in a
                  logical order and answers questions
                - 1 is: does not use the syllabus at all, does not answer
                  questions and does not follow any order

                - reponse choices represent behaviors

            - Mixed Standard Scale
                - a list of behaviors is given
                    - each element is a statement

                - the rater takes each statment, and rates the person baed on
                  that statment
                    - they are better than this
                    - they are worse than this
                    - this is about right for them

            - Behavior Observation Scale
                - contains items based on critical incidents
                - then you say the ammount of time the employee engaged in that
                  behavior

                - you need a lot of judgement to determine what a particuar
                  frquence means

        - Developmentof behavior focused forms
            - 4 steps
                1:  Perform job analysis to define the job dimensions

                2:  Develop descriptions of effective and ineffective job
                    performance from criical incidents

                3:  Hav knowledgable judges place the descriptions into job
                    dimensions

                4:  Have knowledgable judges rate the effectiveness ofthe
                    descriptions

- 360 Degree Feedback
    - ratings of an employee from multiple sources, not just the supervisor

    - comparing how the employee views themselves can be attested with how
      others feel about this employee
        - this can give the employee another perspective


    - people in differnt posisionts of the 360 will have only modest agreement
      in ratings
        - the best performers are the ones who seem to benifit more than the
          worst performers

        - if someone rates themselves low and so do others, this often causes
          bad reactions
            - feeling bad and then having others mark you bad can have bad
              results

    - legal issues
