- Training
    - New employees must learn how to do their job, old employees must learn
      how to keep up with changes

- 5 stages of effective organizational training programs

    -1: conduct training needs assessment
    -2: set objectives
    -3: Design Training
    -4: Deliver Training
    -5: Evaluation Training

- Needs Assessment:
    - determines who needs training and what the content of the training should
      be

    - three levels of assessment:
        - organinzational:
            - a company should determine their goals and this will lead to the
              type of training needed

        - Job Level:
            - nature of tasks involved in each job
            - training for employees based on what they will be doing

        - person level:
            - how well job applicants or employees are able to do job tasks
            - should hopefully remede any issues between what the worker needs
              to know and what they actually know

- objectives
    - define what training success looks like

    - ones we know what the expected output of trainging is, it is much easier
      to design the training program

- Training Design
    - transfer of training:
        - expectation that employees will apply what they have learned to their
          job


    - Trainee Characteristics:
        - Not everyone has the same ability to learn a particular task
            - might need to give different employyes different amount of traing
              in to get everyone up to the same criterion

        - different people learn different ways too

    - Design Factors that Affect Transfer of Training
        - Feedback:
            - important component of learning

        - General Principles:
            - training should terach why something is done as well as how it is
              done

            - including general ideas about something related to the trainging
              can often increase overall success

        - Identical Elements
            - things in the training should be identical to things in the
              workplace when possible

        - Overlearning
            - giving the trainee practice beyond what is necessary to reach the
              criterion
                - this is actually a good thing

            - you want to train people such that they can do the thing with
              little thought

            - not the same thing as retention, and even if someone can do
              something automatically it must be done over a long period of
              time to help then retain it

        - Sequencing of Training Sessions:
            - 2 parts:
                - part vs whole
                    - part trainging:
                        breaking a task into components and learning components
                        one at a time

                    -whole
                        - when the entire task is tautght at one time rather
                          than breaking it up

                - massed vs spaced
                    - massed trainging:
                        - the learning sessions are long and take place over a
                          short period of time

                    - spaced training:
                        - training sessions are short and spread out over time

    - Work Enviornment:
        - if supervisors / managers don't encourage the workers to learn the
          things form the training or that they are needed, then the employees
          will be less motivated to learn them and the training will be less
          effective

    - training methods
        - no one best way to train

        - 8 training methods
            - 1: Audio visual instruction
                - electronic presentatino of materials using audio and or video
                  generally on a computer

            - 2: Auto instruction
                - any self paced training method

            - 3: Conference
                - Meeting of trainees and trainer to discuss the material
                - allows for free flow of ideas

            - 4: Lecture
                - presentation by a trainer to a group of trainees
                    - high efficiency

            - 5: Modeling
                - trainees watch someone perform a task and then model what
                  they saw
                    - has better results than most of the others listed so far

            - 6: on the job training
                - not a particular method, any way of showing employees how to
                  do their job, on the job

            - 7: Role-Playing
                - simulation in which the trainee pretends to be doing a task
                    - part of the modeling procedure

            - 8: simulations
                - specialized equipment and materials are used to portray a
                  task situation


    - Electronic Training
        - the use of electronic tools to provide training

    - Mentoring
        - new employees can benifit from being mentored

    - Executive Coaching
        - helper managers enhance their skills

        - a coach takes in information from workers and considers this input to
          help the manager become better (even if they were good to begin with)

- Evaluation of a training Program
    - principles and techniques of evaluation a training progam are the same as
      the priniples and techniques of the research methodology


    - 5 steps:
        - 1: define the critera
        - 2: design for the study selected
        - 3: measures used to assess the criteria are slected
        - 4: collecting the data
        - 5: analyzing the data

    - set criteria
        - its easy to tell if training was effective the the expected output is
          very explicit and well defined

        - classified into two levels:
            - training level:
                - concerned with what people are able to do at the end of
                  training in the training enviornment rather than the
                  workplace

            - performance level:
                - what is the person's performance on the job after training

                - concerned with transfer of training

        - you can classify criteria into four types:
            - each of them is a partial indicator of the overall success of the
              training program

            - reactions:
                - how much each trainee liked the training and how much they
                  belived they got out of it
                - assessed with a questionare

            - learning
                - what a person learned in training
                - assesed with a test

            - Behavior:
                - concern the trainee's behaviors on the job that might be due
                  to training
                - based on wether or not the employee is doing things like they
                  were taught

            - Results
                - wether the training had its intended effect

    - choose design
        - structure of a study that specifies how data are collected

        - certain criteria require specific designs

        - Pretest-Posttest Design:
            - provide information about how much the trainees gained from the
              training
