DC Motors

- Findamentals of EM Fields
    - The DC motors will use induction to spin the wheels
    - we need to be able to handle a fair amount of current to spin the Wheel

- After the Field
    - we need to create a force from the created field

- Physics of the Motor
    - There is a wire on uor rotor
    - the rotor allows the wire to rotate
    - there are brushes touching the wire, causing current to travel through
      the wire

    - the magnets on the side cause the wire to rotate

    - current
        - looking at current as a fucntion of time

- Connecting the Motor
    - we need an interface to connect the motor to Micro controller.

    - remember that we need to generate quite alot of current (1/2 amp) but the
      current from the microcontroller is about 6mA tops

    - we don't change the volrage applied to the motor to change speed, we just
      change the duty cycle

        - Power to Motor = H / (H+L) * Vm * I
            - we adjust H and L
