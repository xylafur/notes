Battery and Voltage Regulation
    - We want to get a constant voltage to power our system

    - the battery we are using is a NiMH that can provide up to 7.2V


- Power Budget
    - When using something like a microcontroller we have options
        - we could save power by turning particular components on or off

        - out particular launchpad (MSP432) has ease of use modes
        - we can easily put it to sleep or turn off particular components

    - Compare the average current with the voltage we are using
        - this should be less than the storage of our batteries (defined in out
          amp-hours)

    - we want to design the system (if we have that option) such that is uses
      the lowest possible voltage
        - we combine this with our mode regulation to use the lowest total
          power possible

- Amp hours
    - the charge transferred by a steady current of one amp flowing for one
      hour

- Batteries
    - two classes
        - primaray batteries
            - use it once and throw it away


        - secondary batteries
            - rechargable


    - structure
        - We have an electrolite with a cathode (+) on one side and an anode
          (-) on the other side

    - using multiple batteries
        - we sum the voltages together, but we have to consider the amp hour
          used by all of them
            - for instance each of our batteries (NiMH) have voltage of 1.2V
              and each has 1.8 Amp hours of avaliable energy

            - when we combine 6 of them togehter, we will have a voltage of
              7.2V but we still only have 1.8 Amp hours of current/h (at that
              voltage)

- Voltage regulation
    - we run at 5V, not 7.2V

    - The output voltage needs to be constant (duh)
    - we use an amplifier, capacitors and resistors

    - this is very inneficient
        - we turn 7.2V * 100mA => 5V * 100mA
            - we just lose that 2.2V * 0.1A = .22W
            - this thing gets hot because of that (how the energy dissipates

    - We are provided with a linear regulator
        - we have to soder it on with a couple of 4.7 micro farad capacitors


- Voltage regulator with switching regulators
    - a different class of regulators
        - more efficient
        - we lose much less energy to heat


    - they are constructed using a physical switch
        - they generate alot of electro magnetic field noise

        - they use a didode, capacitor and diode


    - the advantage is its muuuuch more efficient

    - disadvantages
        - more complex circuit
        - noisy


- Summary
    - we have a need for regulation because what the board wants is not exactly
      what the batteries provide

    - the ammount of time that our robot will run is directly poportional to
      the current usage by the robot and the current output of the batteries





Lab 1:
    - This lab is to study the batteries and how they power the robot

    - we attach a resisitor to the batteries
        - we connect 2 multimeters, one for measuring current and the toher for
          measuring voltagef

    - we watch and wait to see how long it takes for the batteries to discharge

Lab 2:
    - We are going to power the system from the batteries
