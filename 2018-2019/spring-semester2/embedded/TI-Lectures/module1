Embedded System Constraints:

Real Time Systems: (3 types)
    Hard Real Time:
        A timing constraint will never be missed

        saftey

    Firm Real TIme:
        We are going to do our best to meet deadlines
    
        the value of the sytem is just lowered a bit if we miss it but it still
        functions

        audio, video streaming

    Soft Real TIme:
        value of a task diminishes the later it completes

        email, webservers



Embeded systems are:
    reactive

    have to operate in real time

    have constraints

    ubiquitous

    Systems which combine digital and analog, subsystem and interfaces
