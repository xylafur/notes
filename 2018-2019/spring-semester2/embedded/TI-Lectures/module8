- Interfacing Input Devices Using switches:
    - software driver
        - set of functions to create an abstract module

    - switches
        - switches are either pressed or not pressed...

        - Pull down resistor
            - when the switch is pressed current can easily flow

            - logical low when switch is not pressed

            - this is positive logic
                - pressed maps to high voltage

        - pull down
            - ther way around, switched being closed is logical high

            - negative logic
                - the 'true' input condition (pressed switch), produces a low
                  volrage

        - the two switches on the side of our board are negative logic

- Software Driver
    - set of functions to use a device

    - we have init functions and a suite of functions to be continuously called

LEDs
    - Resistors are linear components

    - Diodes are not linear components.
        - The anode is the positive side and the kathode is the negative side

        - the Current / Voltage graph is exponential in fact

        - the power through the LED is what controls the brightness

        - we need a resistor in series with the LED to control the power
            - the value of the resistor to use can be calculated from:

            R = (power supply V - desired voltage) / desired current

            - where desired volrage * desired current is the power that we want
              for our led
