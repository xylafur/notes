AI:
    Ask yourself if you consider yourself to be intelligent - what are the
    ingredients needed for this?
        - You can take in information and solve problems with that
        - you can drive a car
        - whatever belongs to being intelligent is part of artificial
          intelligence

    AI develops programming paradigms, languages, tools  and enviornments for
    application areas for which conventional programming fails
        it is possible to do this in other programming languages, but may take
        much more code

    The first version of LISP didn't have any numbers

    Soft computing:
        toolboxes, one way to view AI is just a bunch of tools
            compute the probability based on symptoms based on data or something

    The study of how to make computers do things which at the moment people do
    better
        IF there is a restrictive domain, then can we really call them
        artificial intelligence?

        Its harder to make something more generic, rather an AI dedicated to a
        very particular task


Physical Symbol System Hypothesis:
    We ask questions like can computers be creative, can they actually think?

    What the brain does can be thought of, at some level, as a kind of
    computation

    We have to reduce problems to some kind of computation  
        if we can't reduce that to a single kind of computation, we have to do
        the best we can

Knowledge Representation:
    There are sometimes better ways to display a problem that makes it more
    obvious
