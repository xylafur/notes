General Overview of topics we will cover in the course:
    Knowledge Representation:
        Things can be more obvious or intuitive depending on the way in which we
        represent them.

        Sometimes it even reduces the work significantly

    Natural Language Understanding:
        Natural language is very ambigious.  In natrual language processing we
        have to have specific defaults that we assume if the opposite is not
        stated.  We can classify something into a stereotype, and use the
        associated defaults with that stereotype

        Understanding the goals of people, knowing ways of accomplishing those
        goals can be useful to understanding a story


            Example: John wants to buy a house
                - John will have to find a house
                - John will need a way to pay for this house
                    - he could rob a big bank
                    - he could marry a rich woman
                    - etc


            - goals will additionally have sub goals, ways of achieving those
              broader goals
                - Then we are able to form plans based on those goals
                - we can also make subplans for goals

        - Planning:
            - we have those goals and sub goals
            - you have a set of goals and operators
            - based on if we are able to achieve goals or not we might apply
              different operators

    Heuristic Search
        - Heuristo (greek): I find

        - Heuristics: rule of thumb based on experience
            - if we have domain specific knowledge we can adjust our algorithm
              to use that knowledge
            - this can help us reduce the things we need to search
                - then if it fails we can search other things

            - Main ideas:
                - search space reduction



    Evolutionary Computing:
        - Based on the survival of the fittest
            - start off with some initial solutions, then breed new solutions
                - some have properties of mother or father
            - then we only allow the ones that are better to breed more

            
    Soft Computing:
        - in conventional programming you have 2 value logic
            - mostly uses a symbolic 

        - Soft computing is fuzzy logic
            - turning on the AC at 70 vs turning the AC on a little at 70
            - kind of like an analog aproach
                - depending on the specificis of the value we can have different
                  behavior

            - we use things like belief networks that help with decision making

            - can have soft solutions
                - the result needs to be within some threshold rather than some
                  exact value

                - alot of interpolation
                    - constructing a range of new data points within a range of
                      discrete data points

    Learning:
        - the only way you can learn is if you make some error or recieve some
          feedback

        - various types
            - Supervised learning:
                - learning from examples
                - the developer is the one who provides the example

            - Reinforcement Learning:
                - feedback is only received with repect to an action taken by
                  the agent

            - Unsupervised Learning:
                - learning without feedback

        - Classification Model:
            - Pass supplied training data into classification algorithms
                - these algorithms produce a model

            - Then you use unseed data and test it against the model
        
        - KDD (Knowledge discovery in Data):
            - Definition: "KDD is the non-trivial process of identifiying valid
                           novel, potentially useful, and ultimately
                           understandable patterns in data"

Intelligent Agents:
    - Try to simulate what humans do, systems that act like humans
        Ex: Robots that play soccer
        Ex: Robot waiters

    - Many attributes
        - Perception
        - Robotics
        - Language (communication)
        - Knowledge
        - Reasoning
            - Based on what I know, will this happen?

        - Learning
            - assuming you get some sort of feedback

    - Many motivations for doing this
        - make money, help people, etc


AI Tools:
    - a tool that can be used for a specific purpose
        Example: Belief network tools

    - Provide AI techniques in non agent settings


        
if s' is new then U[s'] = r'
if s is not null then
    increment Ns[s]
    U[s] = U[s] + learning rate * (Ns[s],)(r + gamma*U[s'] - U[s])
