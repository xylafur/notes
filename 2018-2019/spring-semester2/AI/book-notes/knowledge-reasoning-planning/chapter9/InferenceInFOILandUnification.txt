- We need a knowledge base in FOPL
    - we can then query this

- Based on a given proposition in FOPL, we can infer
    Vx King(x) ^ Greedy(x) => Evil(x)

    - If we know John is a King, and he is Greedy, we can conclude he is evil
        - if we know his father is a king, and his father is greedy, we can know his
          father is also evil

    - we don't ahve algorithms to solve with the V and ], so we have to come up with this


- For universal instantiation, we substitute all symbols
    - we generate a set of predicates that we can use based on things from our knowledge
      base, then we remove the universal quantifier

    - then you add the new sentences to the knowledge base, and you can remove the old
      FOPL statement

- for existential
    - we just substitute on symbol, and then remove the existential

- if we find values such that these values fit all of the varaibles in our preposition,
  then we can substitute them into our conclusion

- Unification
    - you unify two prep. clauses, the unification returns a substitution

    - we find a substitution to make the two clauses the same
        - for
            UNIFY(Knows(John, x), Knows(y, Bill))

            {y/John, x/Bill} is our substitution
