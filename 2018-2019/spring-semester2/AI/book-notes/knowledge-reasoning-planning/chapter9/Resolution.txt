- A KB system will work through its KB to determine if something is true or not

- Resolution
    - We are going to try and prove a query based on our knowledge base

    - we want to show that our knowledge base implies our query
        KB |= a

        - to do this, we try to show that
            KB ^ ~a

        - is unsatisfiable

    - we prove via contradition of the whole negation
        - we do this in CNF

    - if we have two sets of disjointed literals
        - and one of these from one set of literals is the compliment of one of the
          literals from the other set

        - we can turn that into a set of disjoints which contains everything from the two
          sets except the two elements we removed

        - this is the resolution rule

    - we use the resolution rule, and take the result and add it into the knowlege base
        - we do this until we end up with only the empty case
