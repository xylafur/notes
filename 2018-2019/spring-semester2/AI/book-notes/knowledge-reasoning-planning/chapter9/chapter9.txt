9.1 Propositional vs First Order Inference
    - First order inference can be done by converting the KB to propositional logic and
      using propositional inference

    9.1.1 Inference rules for quantifiers
        - Rule of Universal Instantiation
            - we can infer any sentence obtained by substituting a ground term (term
              without variables) for the variable

            - we use the notion of substitutions to write it formally

                SUBST(B, a)

                Vv a / SUBST({v/g}, a)


        - Existential Instantiation
            - variable is replaced by a single new constant symbol
            - for any sentance with a varaible and constant that does not exist in the KB,

                ]v a / SUBST({v/k}, a)

                - can replace objects with a Skolem constant
                    - the skolem constant is a variable, or in this case a name, that
                      does not exist elsewhere in the knowledge base

                    - this is a special case of skolemization

            - can be applied once, and then the existentially quantified sentance can be
              discarded

                - we don't need ]xKill(x, Victim) after we have added Kill(Murderer, Victim)

    9.1.2 Reduction to propositional inference
        - once we can get non quantified from quantified, we can reduce rist order
          inference to propositional inference

        - to apply Universal Instantiation to a KB, you take all things from the
          knowledge base that fit and then make those substitutions
            - you will end up with a few cases theno

            - this is called propositionalization



9.2 Unification and Lifting
    - propositionalization is rather inefficient
        - our sentences with the existential/universal operators is obvious to a human,
          we will show how to make it obvious to a computer

    9.2.1 A first order inference rule
        - It seems as though we can take the variables in our premiss, search for a
          particular object that fits those premis and then infer the conslusion
            - the objects that we use have to be in the knowledge base, so we can only
              assume based on things that we know

        - this is called, Generalized Modus Ponens
