    P(a|b) = P(a ^ b) / P(b)

13.3 Inference Using Full Joint Distributions
    - probabilistic inference
        - the computation of posterior probabilities for query propositions given
          observed evidence

        - full joint distribution is used as the knowledge base from which answers can be
          derived

            - a joint distribution is a table that lists all of the probabilities of a
              system
                - all of the values in the table should sum up to 1, because they are all
                  probabiltiies for the same outcome

            - marginilization
                - also called summing out
                - add up all of the values fora  particular thing
                    - such as adding up all of the probabilities of the outcome being
                      true

13.5 Bayes' Rule and its use
    - Product Rule
        P(a ^ b) = P(a|b)P(b) = P(b|a)P(a)

        => P(b|a) = P(a|b)P(b) / P(a)

        - this is bayes' rule


    - Application
        P(cause|effect) = P(effect|cause)P(cause) / P(effect)

        - there are many cases where we know P(effect|cause), P(cause), and
          P(effect)

        - Casual direction
            P(effect|cause)

        - Diagnostic Direction
            P(cause|effect)

    - Bayes rule with 2 or more conditions
        P(toothache ^ catch | cavity) = P(toothache | cavity) P(catch | cavity)
            - this only works if the two things are independent
            - as long as catch does not depend on toothache, and the other way
              around, then this formula is valid

        - general rule for conditional independance
            P(X, Y | Z) = P(X|Z)P(Y|Z)

    - The independance is a really good thing, it allows us to break large
      probabilistic domains into weakly connected subsets.

    - Naive Bayes Model
        - assume the efects are independent
            - even when soemtimes they aren't, this is why its called naive

        P(Cause, effect1, ..., effect-n) = P(cause) P(effect1, Cause) ... P(effect-n, cause)
