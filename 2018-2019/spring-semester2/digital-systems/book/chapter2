- Number systems and codes:
    - BCD Code:
        - when a decimal number is represented as the binary equivalend, this
          is called straight binary coding
            - sometimes it is useful (for speed reasongs) to represent a number
              as some combinarion of decimal and binary

        - Binary-Coded-Decimal Code
            - each digit of a decimal number is represented by its binary
              equivalent
                - ex: 874 == 1000 0111 0100

            - 4 bits are always used for each digit
                - 2 digit decimal numbers are not valid
                - so 0000 to 1001

            - comparison of BCD and binary
                - BCD is not a number system, its kind of a hack of the regular
                  decimal number system
    - The Gray Code
        - when multiple input conditions change to a digital system, this can
          be misinterpreted and cause an error
            - Gray code is a way of trying to reduce the probability of errors

        - only one bit will ever change between numbers

        - the most significant bit is the same as in binary,
            - the other bits in gray code represent wether adjacent binary bits
              are the same or different

    - The byte, nibble and word
        - nibble
            - half a byte, 4 bits

        - words
            - a group of bits that represents a certain unit of information
            - the size of the word depends on the size of the data pathway in teh
              system

    - alphanumeric codes
        - in a nutshell: the codes that represent all of the characters on your
          keyboard

        - ascii:
            - 7 bit code
            - padded with a zero as the left most digit

    - parity method for error detection
        - whenever information is transmitted from one device (the transmitter)
          to another devices (the receiver) there is a possibility that errors
          can occur
            - a major cause of these transmission errors is electrical noise

            - the most common way of detecting and possibly correcting errors
              caused by electrical noise is a pairity bit

        - pairity bit
            - extra bit attached to a code group being transfered.  The bit is
              given its value in one of two ways

                - even pairity bit
                    - the pairity bit is chosen so that the total number of 1s
                      in the group is even
                        - if one of these bits randomly flips during
                          transmission, we will know because there will be an
                          odd number of 1s

                - odd pairity bit
                    - the same thing as the even pairity, but uses an odd
                      number of 1s instead of an even

                - neither of these methods would work if two bits were fliped
                  instead of just one
