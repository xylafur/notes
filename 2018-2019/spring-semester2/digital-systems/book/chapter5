Flip Flops and Related Devices

- Combinational vs Sequential Circuits
    - So far we have been using combinational
    - In combinational circuits, there is no memory.
        - we just have the gates
        - the output of these gates is based only on their input

    - Sequential circuits use memory elements called Flip-Flops
        - A flip flop is just an element constructed from Gates that has a
          notion of state

        - Flip flops are known by other names such as Latch and Bistable
          Multivibrator

5-1 Nand Gate Latch
    - Two Nand gates are cross coupled so the output of NAND1 is one of the
      inputs to NAND2 and vice versa
        - these outputs are also the outpout of the circuit

    - We have two inputs, one connected to one NAND and the other conencted to
      the other
        - they represent SET and RESET repectively

        - both should be held high at all times unless we are going to set or
          unset

    - The set and reset triggers for the NAND latch are active low.
        - We pulse one of them with a low signal to either set or reset the
          latch

5-2 NOR Gate Latch
    - We can make the same construct as we did in the last subchapter but using
      NOR gates.  All that happens is the inputs become active high instead.

    - When we first supply power to the circuit, it is not possible to predict
      the starting state of the latch


5-4 Digital Pulses
    - a propogating wave with only one crest or trough

    - a pulse is called positive when it is low and then goes high momentarily

        1     _
        0 ___/ \___

    - a pulse is negative if it is high and then goes low momentarily

        1 ____   ______
        0     \_/

    - we consider these pulses to be square, but they aren't actually
        - rise time and fall time signify the time it takes the voltage to go
          between 10% and 90% of the total vlaue



    - the leading edge is the first slope (when the pulse goes from its
      starting positin to its pulsed position) and the trailing edge is when it
      returns to its original position

    - the pulse width is the time between when the leading edge and trailing
      edge are at 50% of their total value


5-5 Clock Signals and Clocked Flip FLops
    - with a clock signal, we can create synchronous systems
        - the state of a flip flop can only change when the clock signal is
          high or low (depending on how we define it)

        - these changes don't happen when the clock is in a particular state,
          but rather when it is transitioning between particular states
            - this transisition is called an edge

    - setup and hold times
        - setup time
            - how long the input to a flip flop must be held at that value
              before the clock edge

        - hold time
            - the time that that signal must be held after the clock edge

5-10 Asynchronous Inputs
    - We have been dealing with the syncronous inputs of various flip flop
      types, they are only used on the correct clock edge
        - most clocked FF also have one or more asynchronous inputs

        - they act as override inputs and can be used to set or unset the flip
          flop independent of the clock and other inputs

        - they take precedence over the regular sync inputs

5-11 Flip Flop Timing Considerations
    - Maximum Clocking Frequency
        - there is a limit to the speed of our clock
        - any faster than this and the flip flop won't trigger reliably

    - Clock Pulse High and Low times
        - the manufacruter will specify how long the clock must remain low
          before it goes high and how long it must stay high before it goes
          low

5-12 Potential Timing Problem in FF Circuits
    - we assume that any flip flop will consider the input that it is given
      immedietly before the correct edge trigger for that flip flop.

    - so if we have two flip flops connected, the second will take whatever
      value was present to it from the first before the edge trigger
        - then on the edge trigger it actually makes that change
