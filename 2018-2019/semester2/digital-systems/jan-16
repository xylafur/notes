Chapter 1:
    1-1 Introduction to 1s and 0s:
        - Analog is one of continuous values
        - Digital is one of a set of discrete values

    1-3 Digital and Analog Systems:
        - Digital systems manipulate values in digital form
            - Advantages:
                - Ease of design
                - accuracy and precision are easier to maintain
                - programable operatoin
                - less affected by noise
                    - analog 'noise' will not be able to distort due to the fact
                      that they operate very differently

                - Ease of fabrication (using IC chips)

            - Limitations:
                - everything around us is analog, so to deal with digital
                  technology we have to convert from analog to digital

                - we have to convery a physical thing into an analog electrical
                  signal.
                    - then we can convert this to digital
                    - then we can process this information usinging digital
                      logic
                    - then we have to convert the output back into analog


        - Analog systems manipulate values in analog form
            - basically anything in real life is analog
            - any sound we hear is analog in nature

        - Generally sensors are analog - or produce analog output
            - this means that we're going to have to convert it before we can
              process it using digital logic

    1-5 Representing Binary Quantities:
        - There is a threshold of invalid values between what represents 0 and
          what represents 1
            - for example maybe 0V to .8V represents 0 and 2V to 5V represents 1
                - gates are designed in this way.  So I guess that these values
                  depend on the threshold of the gate on the transistor

            - This is called TTL (transistor transistor logic)
                - the IC's in our system based on this, we have a range of
                  voltages like this

            - CMOS:
                - something completley different than TTL
