- I just went back and updated monday's notes

#   Machine Learning intro
###############################################################################
- We want to optimize form performance criterion
    - What percentage accuracy of classification for example

- We have either a teacher or examples

- Machine learning is the study of algorithms that improve their performance
  with experience

- Supervised Learning
    - We have training examples
        - our dataset with alot of information
        - the output is the label

    - learns a 'model'
        - the model takes the properties of the input and returns either a
          classification

- unsupervised learning
    - association analysis

- we need to preprocess this data as well as summarize it in the end

- transfer learning
    - we have algorithms that predict crime and we want to use this knowledge
      to predict bad doctors

    - use information from one domain to inform about another domain

- Deep learning
    - "make everything big"

    - neural networks with like 5000 layers

- There is no way to specify what you already know with machine learning models
    - models have to start from scratch!

#   Review!
###############################################################################
- There is a review list on his webpage!
    - it has questions and answers

- if something is not in the review, then it won't be on the test

- Nash Equlibrium (number 2 from the review)
    - the algorithm is in the slides
        - go thorough the slutions of 1 player, and assume the best solution
          for the other player
            - if one player chooses this, whats the best option for the other
              guy

        - a nash equilibrium is whenever a particular choice is best for both
          playes
            - it is possible for a game to have more than one nash equilibrium
            - it is also possible for a game to not have any nash equilibriums

- reinforcment learning (number 3 form review)
    - for probabailstic moves, we need to figure out the value of choosing a
      particular movement
        - this is called the expected probability of a particular operator

- temporal difference learning (also number 3):
    - all utilities are initially 0


- evolutionary computing (number 5):
    - crossover operator
        - also called explotation operator

        - takes peices of parents and never introduces anything new

    - role of mutation operator in evolutionary computing
        - random changes, potential to introduce something new

    - rollete rule selection
        - the proportion that each solution gets depends on its fitness
          relative to the sum of all fitness

- A*
    - guaranteed to find the optimal solution, but not guaranteed to be
      efficient

    - heuristic is not admissible if we over estimate
