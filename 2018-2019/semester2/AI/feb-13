##  Assignments
###############################################################################
The first exam will be March 1st!
PS2 will be due after spring break
We are prerty much done with search

We will try to develop an evolutionary computing function such that we can
solve the traveling salesman


We have some reading material!
    - this is on his website in the lectrues section somewhere

Homework
    - Number 6 does not have to be generic
        - it only has to solve this particular problem

    - we will have a new file uploaded soon wthat has more in depth
      instructions on how to and what to submit

##  Evolutionary Computing
###############################################################################

- Evolutionary Computing
    - As a search
        - Works with population of solutions

    - can also be used as a machine learning paradigm

    - a part of computer science, not biology

        - takes treminology from bioloigy
            - Enviornment   ->  problem
            - Individual    ->  candidate solution
            - fittenss      ->  quality

        - Based on Darwinian Evolution
            - part 1
                - instincts and lifecycles of lifeforms are geared toward
                  reproduction

                - fittness in natural evolution is derived
                    - we assign high fitness to individuals with many offspring

            - part 2
                - phenotypic traits
                    - determine physical differences, unique to each individual

                    - can be inherited if the owner mates

            - everybody in the population has particular qualities
                - some of these qualities are good
                - we breed them such that we obtain all combination of
                  qualities

    - Mutation
        - a child can obtain generic material not inherited from either parent

        - usually bad in biology, usually good in EC

        - can cause changes that won't come from crossover alone
            - can be catastrophic, neutral or advantageous

    - Modelling
        - we want to learn our model
        - we have inputs and outputs, want to determine what the model is
            - develop some sort of prediction model

    - Simulation
        - we are given the module, and want to answer what if questions (obtain
          the output) based on input

    - building systems that adapt
        - we take in some sort of enviornemntal response and produce a behavior

        ????

        - we adapt over time?

###############################################################################
##  Traveling Salseman
###############################################################################
- The traveling salseman problem
    - problem statement
        - We are given cities and costs to travel between cities

        - we have to visit every city and end up back where we started

        - we want to find the optimal path such that the cost is the minimum


    - using evlutionary computing to solve
        - we might take two solutions
        - then we try using the cross over operator to take some particular
          paths from one solution and the other

        - typical Mutation operators
            - all os these operators are randomized, for any given operator
              there are multiple ways that the chromisomal set can be
              manipulated
                - te selection of those particular ways is based randomness

            - neightbor swapping
                - just swap two various cities
                - then we will end up with 2 different paths

            - inversino transformation
                - flip a particular section

            - insertion transform
                - pick one or a sectino and insert it somewhere else in the
                  list


- Key components of an EC system
    - Chromosomal Representation
        - the way in which we model the problem
        - for the traveling salseman it is the list of cities we travel in
          order
            - we not want the 1 in our chromosomal representation
            - we could just assume that it has a one at the beginning

        - we can create some sort of normal form (he might be talking about the
          chromosomal representation)
            - we put the representation in a normal form so we can identify i
              two are the same


    - Generitc Operators
        - The biologicial operators (like cross over)
            - This is something different? He went off on a tangent

            - we need some sort of comain specific cross over operator

    - Selection Mechanism

    - population managment
        - who lives and who dies


- Rulette WHeel selection
    - we have some solutions and the associated fitness val

    s1: 0.7
    s2: 0.2
    s3: 0.1

    - then we create a roulette whell (basically a pie chart that uses the
      numbers from the solutions fitness

        - then we take a random number and select one of the elements form the
          wheel based onthat number
            - we do this twice, and then create an offspring with those two
            - if we get the same solution twice we just copy it

        - basically we spin the wheel

- Tournament Selection
    - doesn't care about the place, we only use the winner
        - didn't understand the method of choosing the winner, but there is a
          very low probability that we choose a solution with small fittness
          function
