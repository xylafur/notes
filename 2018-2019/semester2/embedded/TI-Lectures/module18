- Serial Communication
    - Fifo queue
        - data buffer used to hold data as it passes through our system

- FIFO queue
    - bueffer, stores data

    - we will be using it in a system that creates data
        - something lilke an input device

    - and with something that uses or destroys data

    - we store data in the FIFO for awhile while its passed from producer to
      consumer

- Empty FIFO
    - we have two pointers, one at the beginning (where we will be reading from
      ) and one at the end (where we will be writing to)
        - if the two are pointing to the same location, then the queue is empty

- Little's Theorem
    - we can define the average response time for a packet based on the arrival
      rate and the total number of pending packets

    - N = :lambda: * R
