Data Acquisition Systems
    - we are going to sample the distance from a transducer

    - we need to know how to sample data from our world
        - we're gonna discuss how we use the ADC


We will be using the IR Distance transducer
    - it is very noisy


This is a control system, we have something that we will be controlling
    - we will use the distance to wall from the IR sensor as our transducer /
      input

    - then we use the ADC and give it to the microcontroller

Sampling / converions from analog to digital
    - to convert something that is continious into something discrete

    - two limitations
        - there is a minimum and maximum distance that we can measure
            - and we only have a particular count of digits, so we have a
              particular 'resolution'
                - resolution is the smallest difference that we can measure

            - when we do the A->D conversion we don't get the actual answer,
              just something that is close to it

        - time limitation
            - depending on our sample frequency, we will have some maximum
              discrete value frequency

            - if we sample at 1Hz, we can represent the signals from 0->1/2 HZ

            - we have a minimum and maximum time
                - depending on our buffer size, we will have another limitation

                - we have a 'frequency resolution'
                    - the sampling rate / number of elements in array

        - We have an approcimation in amplitude adn in time
            - in amplitude its determined by the A-D converter
            - in time its determined by the sampling rate we run our A-D
              converter


MSP432 ADC14
    - if we set up the ADC in 3.3 V it will take a voltage in between 0 and 3.3
      it will convert it to a number between 0 and 16,383


    - the faster we sample, the more noise we will get

Doing the conversion in software
    - we wait until the ADC is ready
    - we then set the 'software start' bit
    - then we wait until the ADC is finished sampling
    - then we have the output

Jitter
    - the variation in our sampling times
    - in a real time system, we want a low jitter
    - we want it to be much much less than the time we want to be out sampling
      time

Data Aquisition Systems Continued
    - in the last video we talked about using an ADC converter and sampling at
      some particular rate

    - This video is about noise!
        - how we might determine how much noise there is
        - and how to reduce that noise


Nyquist Theorem:
    - if we sample at 2000 Hz
        - then all of the input signals between 0 and 1000Hz would be properly
          sampled

        - any signal that is >= 1/2 fs (1000Hz) is going to enduce an error
            - this error is called aliasing

    - Spectrum analyzer
        - we will view our signal in the frequency domain
        - this gives us the amplitude of the fignal as a function of frequency

        - we will just throw away any signals beyond 1/2 fs
            - this can fold down and cause an error though

        - if the amplitude is less than some particular value, we can just
          throw it away
            - and signal less than 3.3V / 16384 will be undetectable

Noise Statistics
    - in a static manner
        - we consider the distance to the wall in mm as P1
            - we do this a multitude of times
            - for each measurement we count the number of times we get it
            - this will give us our probability mass function
                - the number of times each measurement was created

            - the average is an estimate of the signal
                - the standard deviation is an estimate of the noise

            - we consider the coeficient of variation
                - the noise / amplitude of the signal

                - if we take log abse 2 of this, we get the number of bit
                  associated with the noise

        - then we repeat this with a new actual distance

        - the definition of resolution is
            - if we were to change the signal by some amount, our system can
              detect it

            - so if the two mask functions are statistically different, then
              the resolution is less than the distance between the two
              distances

Transducer
    - we take in some distance as the input
    - the output is some voltage

    - it will send out light and get it back

    - problems
        - non monotonic
            - there are two possible distances for a particular voltage

            - to handle it, we restrict the range

        - hyperbolic
            - the graph that we get when we plot voltage against distance is
              not linear

Getting rid of noise
    - Probability Mass function
        - gives us a statistic of the noise to actual data

    - central limit theorem
        - if we take our data and we add it up
            - as we add more and more data that is independent and random
            - as the number of data elements is aproaching inf the curve
              becomes gaussian



    - Analog Filter
        - 

    - Digital Filter
        - averaging filter
            - we average the last N data points

            - low pass nature


Problems with filters
    - we have a tradeoff between noise and speed
