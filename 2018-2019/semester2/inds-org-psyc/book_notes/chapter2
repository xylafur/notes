Research Methods

- Accurately asscessing something with IO
    - use a scientific experiment with a control group
        - muse make sure non control is not aware that they are being
          monitored, this can lead to the hawthorne effect

        - none of the participants must be aware that they are being monitored
          or it can effect results

- Research Questions
    - a question needs to be very specific in regards to what it is studying
        - the very particular factor in question sould be specified.
        - to broad of a question may have too many variables

        - we want to narrow the question so that we are really only measuring
          one variable

- Important Research and Design concepts
    - generalizability:
        - conclusions of a study can be extended to people of another group
        - often a concern for studys that take place in a lab.  Will this study
          have the same results out in the field?

    - Random assignment and random selection:
        - Random assignment
            - means of controlling for subject variables that are not of
              intrest
                - we assign people to 'treatment conditions' randomly
                    - For example the people who are selected to be trained are
                      actually randomly selected from everyone

            - both groups should have roughly the same characteristics if it is
              not what we are measuring.  If age is not important, both groups
              should have roughly the same distribution of ages

        - Random Selection
            - The subjects in the study are chosen by a nonsystematic method
            - we choose people from all pools, not just one

    - Confounding
        - two or more variables are intertwined in such a way that conclusions
          can not be drawn about either one

        - you want to do your best to seperate these two factors so that you
          can draw accurate conclusions about the other


    - Research Designs
        - the basic structure of a scientific study
            - can be either experiemental with active manipulation of
              conditions or passive observation

        - Experiments
            - design in which there are one or more independent variables and
              one or more dependent variables as well as a random assigmnet of
              subjects

            - field experiemnt: done in an organization rather than lab
                - generalizability is more likely

            - quasi-experiment design: one or more of the features of a true
              experiment have been comprimised


        - Survey Designs
            - series of questions to study one or more variables of interest


            - cross sectional design
                - all data were collected at a single point in time

            - longitudinal design
                - data collected from more than one point in time

            - disadvantages
                - employees are not good sources of info about variables of
                  interest
                    - people overrate their own performance

                - cross sectional nature of most surveys makes it difficult to
                  draw conclusions about which variables were likely to be the
                  cause of which other variables
                    - longitudinal designs can be more helpful for drawing
                      conclusions

                - usually response rate is low, which means you didn't get a
                  good sample size

            - Experience Sampling
                - repeated measurements over short time intervals
                - helps reduce biases from faulty memory

        - Observational Design
            - researcher observes employees in their organizational settings
            - can be done with or without the employees knowledge

        - Qualitative Studies
            - reliance on nonquantitative methods

            - generally researcher observes and records information in a
              narrative form

                - conslusions can be drawn from observance of the same behavior
                  multiple times

                - can be a good means to generate a hypothesis from
                  observations


- Measurement
    - process of assigning numbers to characteristis of people or things

    - either categorical or continuous
        - categorical measurement
            - values of a variable represent discrete categories
            - numbers on a football team are a good example

            - the numbers don't represent some actual measurement, more just a
              hash or something

        - continuous measurement
            - numbers represent an amount of the characteristic in question


    - Classical Measurement Theory
        - ever observation of a variable can be divided into to components:
          true score and error

        - errors are random influences on the observed score

        - each item in a test contains both a true score and an error, they
          should cancel eachother out
            - this does not guearrentee that we are accessing what we intended
              to access

    - Reliability
        - consistency of measurement across repeated observations of a variable
          in the same subject
            - something is reliable if the error is low

        - Internal consistency reliability
            - how well multiple measures for the same subject agree

        - Rating
            - Inter-rater reliability is the extent to which ratings by two of
              more raters are related to one another

        - test retest reliability
            - the consistency of measurement when it is repeated over time

        - the first requirement of a measure is that it is reliable
            - this is not the only consideration though, we do not know if the
              measure is valid or not


    - Validity
        - has to do with inferences that can are made about what an observed
          score measures or represents

            - not a measuring device, but inferences made about a measuring
              device

        - types of validity
            - Face validity
                - mesure appears to access what it was designed to access

                - not always the best thing, things can seem to provide face
                  validity but aren't actually valid

            - Content Validity
                - multiple item measure of a variable does an adequate job of
                  covering the entire domain of the variable

            - Criterion-related validity
                - scores on a measure of inteset relate to other measures that
                  they should relate to in theory
