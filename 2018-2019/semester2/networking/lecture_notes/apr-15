Link Layer Continued

- Link Layer addressing and forwarding
    - we are to send something from one computer to another
        - a to b

    - layer 3
        - is worried about conneting things end to end
        - source and destination ip addresses will never change
            - any router along the way that passes this along will see this

        - the router will look at the source address
            - based on its routing table it will send it to the following ip
              address over a particular wire

            - the only thing that the routing table can have is something on
              the same local lan
                - basically a router can only forward stuff that it is directly
                  connecte to


    - layer 2
        - you will only see things on the local lan
            - things on the same side of a router

        - how do you know the destination mac address? (ARP)
            - you broadcast the destinatin ip address and ask for the mac
              address
                - the router will see this and respond with his mac address

        - the hardware devices between each hop will change
        
        - you broacast the ethernet frame to everyone, if its someones
          destination address they read the packet

    - you're only on a lan when you're in transmission
        - there is no ethernet information inside of the router, only when it
          is reading stuff in from a data link or writing stuff out to a data
          link

- Ethernet
    - why use a switch?
        - it will filter out stuff not for a particular destination

    - the layer where you are converting 1's and 0's to whatever medium

    - frame structure
        - since we are dealing with endless 1's and 0's, we have a very special
          pattern that signifies the beginning of a frame and another one that
          signifies the end of a frame

    - unreliable, connectionless
        - no start or stop signals
            - people are all just trying to send shit on the wire and don't
              care about others


        - if your frame doesn't make it, wait awhile and try again
            - if it still doesn't make it, wait a little longer and try again

    - ethernet switch
        - sits in the middle of a bunch of ethernet wires and filters out
          things for the wrong people

            - the switch will watch the poeple thats connected to it and figure
              out who is who

            - switches won't change anything on a packet (as far as we are
              concerned)


- VLAN
    - pretend like a particular set of hosts are on a seperate local network
    - particular mac addresses are treated differently
        - only these particular mac addresses can access these particular
          servers

    - really important security systrem
