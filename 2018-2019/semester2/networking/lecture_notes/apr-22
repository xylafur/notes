- Chapter 6: Wireless and Mobile Networks
    - background
        - you have addresses on wireless just like you do on wired networks
            - we use mac addresses the same as we do for ethernet
            - this is because the same people from IEEE that manage ethernet
              stuff manage this stuff too

    - elements
        - out of all the towers that you can detect
            - you choose the best bet based on strength and users and stuff

        - phones and tablets are basically 2 way radios
            - now adays we can have a single antena that can pick up multiple
              frequencies
                - it is a spiral 

    - wireless entwork
        - you don't have to have a base station
        - you can have an ad hoc network, where everyone is just able to
          communicate with eachother

        - can inject special header information into the existing headers
            - this can help providers communicate stuff


        - characteristics
            - loose signal strength much more quickly than ethernet or
              something

            - propogates in all directions, not directed towards the target
                - really prone to interference, anything radiation that is the
                  same frequency

            - multipath propogation
                - signal bouncing around will arrive later at the same
                  destination and can interfere with the strongest signal that
                  makes it first

            - signal to noise ratio
                - for wire connected networks, you can assume that you'll be
                  able to transmit data perfectly from one locatin to another

    - Code Division Multiple Access
        - a unique code is assigned to each user

        - you multiple your data to send by your unique chipping sequence

        - then the reciever multiplies the sender's chipping code with teh
          recieved data and it will get the original message

            - bits are either 1 or -1, thats why this works

        - if there are more than one senders, their output messages (agter the
          encoding) are added together
            - there will be some numbers greater than 1, you know thre is more
              than one person

- WIFI
    - the major wireless that we use
    
    - there are multiple valid / accepted frequencies that can be used

    - SSID
        - name of a network

        - each host must associate with it to connect to the network

    - collision
        - no way to detect collisions with wifi

        - CSMA/CA
            - raise our hand for permission, respind if we we called on or back
              off for awhile if someone else is called

            - reserve a channel rather than random access

                - RTS (request to send)
                    - if you can, you get responded with a CTS (clear to send)


- Frames (addressing)
    - three spaces for mac addresses
        - the person intended to recieve frame
        - the person transmitting
        - the mac address of the router that the access point is using

- Personal Area Networks
    - bluetooth is an example
    - need some ad hoc way to make someone a leader
