13:
    Each of the input cards will have its own copy of the routing table to
    enable high speed routing.  Additionally each input card will have its own
    queue

14:
    Only FIFO will ensure that packets leave in the same order that they
    arrive.  All of the other queuening techniques will require some sort of
    ordering (based on weight or giving everyone a time slot)

15:
    Byte offset 10 which contains the protocol used as an 8 bit value

16:
    Time to live, byte offset 9.  8 bit value that determines how many more
    hops this particular packet can make before it should be killed


17:
    

18:
    Each interface has its own ip address, each ip address is connected to its
    own lan.  Since there are 8 interfaces, the router will have 8 ip addresses


19:
    202.3.14.25

    0xCA 0x03 0x0E 0x19

    1100 1010 0000 0011 0000 1110 0001 1001

20:
    a)
        Input and output interface for each of the routers.  So 2 * number or
        routers

        8

    b)
        Only one for each input interface, the routing table tells the router
        which interface to send the packet out of

        So 4


21:
    We could also have to consider the header / footer of tcp or udp but this
    is not given so we will ignore it.

    Since 20 bytes is for the ip header, we have 1480 bytes to work with.

    Because of this, the number of datagrams needed is equal to
        ceil(5000000 / 1480) = ceil(3378.3783783783783) = 3379
