c++: list -> vector
    allocation:
        you can create a list either the stack or the heap.
        Using the new keyword will allocate memory from the heap

    manipulation:
        you can use a pointer to manipulate or pass around the vector in c++,
        you can also pass it in using the reference keyword

    clean up:
        If you allocate the list from the heap then you will have to manuall
        clean it up.

    array example:
        int arr [50];

    list example:
        std:vector myarr = new vector;


In Java, lists (ArrayList would be the type) are objects so they are created on
the heap.  
    
    allocation:

    manipulation:
        objects are passed into functions by reference implicitly.

    clean up:
        Java has garbage collection, which means as the programmer you do not
        free memory that you were granted from the heap.  WHen there is not
        enough free memory garabge collection will be invoked and release all
        unused heap memory

    array example:
        int [] arr = new int [50];

    list example:
        std:vector myarr = new vector;



python:
