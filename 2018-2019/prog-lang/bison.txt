tokens in bison have both token type and a semantic value
    grammar rules know nothing about tokens except their types

    the semantic value has contains what the thing actualy is
        token: INTEGER
        value: 4

grammar rules in bison can also have associated actions that are made up of C
statements
    when bison recognizes a match as a rule, it executes the action

    example (rule that says an expression can be the sum of two subexpressions

        expr: expr '+' expr     { $$ = $1 + $3 };

    the action says how to produce the semantic value of the sum expression
    from the values of the two subexpressions

Writing GLR Parsers:
    bison's default parsing algorithm is LR(1), this cannot always decide
    whether to apply a cerain grammar rule at a given point.
        it may not be able to decide based on what has been read so far which
        grammar rule to apply:
            reduce/reduce conflict

        it may not know if it needs to read more input and apply a reduction
        later:
            shift/reduct conflict

    if the grammar used is not easily modified into LR(1), a more general
    parsing algorithm may be needed
        you can include 
            %glr-parser 
        among the bison declarations, this will result in a generalized LR
        parser
            handle bison grammars that contain no unresolved conflicts

            when faced with shift/reduce and reduce/reduce, it does both
                basically splits in two branches

                each of these branches could encounter the same problem and
                split again

                branches either hit a parsing error and die, or it merges with
                another parser because they produce the same set of symbols

            while there are multiple parsers semantic actions are recorded but
            not performed

Using GLR on Unambigious Grammars:
    good in cases where you need mroe than one symbol of look ahead

    GLR can take quadratic or cubic worst-case time


    if the context containing the conflict cannot be nested, then you won't hit
    bad case complexities
    an example of the case where the complexity is not nested is listed below

        

        %token TYPE DOTDOT ID

        %left '+' '-'
        %left '*' '/'


        %%
        type_decl: TYPE ID '=' type ';' ;

        type:
            '(' id_list ')'
        | expr DOTDOT expr
        ;


        id_list:
            ID
        | id_list ',' ID
        ;


        expr:
            '(' expr ')'
        | expr '+' expr
        | expr '-' expr
        | expr '*' expr
        | expr '/' expr
        | ID
        ;

    when this is passed into a normal LR(1) grammar, bison complains about one
    reduce/reduce conflict.  THe parser will just choose one, probably wrong
    
    if we change the grammar to be used to GLR, it will resolve this

    there are 2 potential problems:
        1: analyze conflicts reported by bison to make sure that GLR splitting
           is only done
           a GLR parser splitting when it doesn't need to can cause problems
           much less obvious that a LR parser
        2: consider interactions with the lexer
           once a split parser consumes tokens without performing any actions
           during the split, the lexer cannot obtain information via parser
           actions

Locations:
    to produce verbose and userful error messages we must keep track of the
    textual location or each syntactic construct

    in bison, each token has its semantic calue as well as an associated
    location

    we can get these locations through actions , @$ is the location of the
    whole grouping, @1, @3 can be used to get subexpressions

    when a rule is matched, there are default actions to compute the semantic
    value as well as the locations
        by default, bison takes the location of the beginning of the first
        symbol and the end of the last symbol
