Q1 - What are digital Encoders and Decoders? Give an application of each? Is it
     sequential or combinatorial element:

    Encoders are circuits which take in some input signal, and output some
    code.  A decoder is the opposite of this, a circuit that takes in the code
    generated by a encoder and outputs the signal that would have been the
    input to the encoder.

    Encoders and Decoders are asynchronous components, they generally do not
    have a clock signal.

    Encoders can be used for many things, such as determining the angle of some
    system based on the input or taking some input signal and reducing it to
    fewer signals as a code for transmission purposes.  A decoder would be used
    with the transmission encoder from the previous example so that the data
    that was encoded can be deciphered.


Q2 - Draw the Block diagram of 3:8 decoder and explain its working? How long
     does it a signal to propagate through the encoder?

    The 3:8 decoder takes in an input code that consists of three signals.
    Based on this input, one of 8 outputs is driven high.  For instance if the
    input to the decoder input is '000' then only the output D0 will be driven
    high.    But if the input '010' is given to the decoder, then only the output D2
    will be driven high.

     If 3 input gates can be used, then the logic level for this decoder will
     be 2.  The time taken for the signal to propogate through this decoder
     will thus be the logic level times the propogation time of each of these
     gates.


Q3 - Where can the Decoder be used in the architecture of the microprocessor? 
    A decoder could be used to turn an instruction into activating the
    component of the processor required to compute that instruction.
    

Q4 - Develop the VHDL Entity for:
    entity Decoder is
        port (
            inp : in  std_logic_vector(2 downto 0);
            outp: out std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
        );
    end Decoder;

    architrcture Behavior of Decoder is
    begin
        process(inp)
        begin
            case inp is
                when "000" => outp <= "00000001";
                when "001" => outp <= "00000010";
                when "010" => outp <= "00000100";
                when "011" => outp <= "00001000";
                when "100" => outp <= "00010000";
                when "101" => outp <= "00100000";
                when "110" => outp <= "01000000";
                when "111" => outp <= "10000000";
            end case;
        end process;
    end Behavior;


Q5 -  Is it sequential or combinatorial element?
    This is a combinational element, there is no input clock signal.

Q6 - How long does it a signal to propagate through the encoder?
    This is probably implemented on the FPGA using a mux.  SO it will take
    however long it takes for a signal to propogate through the mux
