- Harddrive
    - SATA and SCSI put sectors in order on the same track on a hard drive
        - he didn't elaborate a whole lot


    - disk performance issues
        - seek time
            - locality and OS scheduling lead to smaller seek time

        - smart disk controllers allocate physical sectors on disk
            - present logical sector interface to host

            - scsi, ata, sata


        - disk drives have cache
            - they prefetch sectors in anticipation of access

            - helps to avoid seek and rotational delay


- Measuring IO performance
    - depends on
        - hardware
            - cpu
            - memory
            - controllers
            - buses

        - software
            - operating system
            - database managment system

        - workload
            - request rates and patterns
