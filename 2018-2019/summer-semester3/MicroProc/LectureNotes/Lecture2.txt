- Response Time and Throughput
    - Response time
        - How long it takes to do a task

    - Throughput
        - Total work done per unit time

- Relative Performance
    - Performance vs Execution Time
        Performance = 1 / Execution Time
        Performance_x / Performance_y = Execution_time_y / execution_time_x = n


- Measuring Execution Time
    - Elapsed time
        - Total reponse time, including
            -  processing
                - time the cpu actually spends running the instructions

            - IO
                - anything that comes from outside, would include sensors
                - the slowest component

            - OS Overhead
                - managment and scheduling

            - idle time
                - time spend waiting.  Time waiting to be scheduled
            

    - CPU Time
        - This is what we will be focusing on today
        - Time spent processing a given job

- CPU Clocking
    - every clock period, data is transfered or processed

- CPU Time
    CPU Time = CPU Clock Cycles * Clock Cycle Time
             = CPU Clock Cycles / Clock Rate

    - performance can either be improved by reducing the number of clock cycles
      or by increasing the clock rate

- Example
    We are given computer A with clock rate 2 GHz and CPU Time of 10s.  We want
    to design a Computer 2 such that the CPU time is 6s.  When we increase the
    clock, the number of instructions is 1.2 times greater.  What should the
    clock freq of the new cpu be?

    - First we need to figure out the number of instructions that CPU A runs
        Clock Cycles = CPU Time * Clock Rate
                     = 10 * 2 * 10 ** 9
                     = 20 * 10 ** 9 cycles

    - Then we need to determine the Clock rate of the Computer B
        Clock Rate = Clock Cycles * 1.2 / CPU Time
                   = 20 * 10**9 * 1.2  / 6
                   = 4.0 * 10**9

- Instruction Count and CPI    
    Clock Cycles = Instruction Count * Cycles per Instruction

    CPU Time = Instruction Count * CPI * Clock Cycle Time

    - The instruction count is influenced by the
        - Program, ISA and compiler

    - Average Cycles per Instruction
        - determined by the CPU hardware
        - if different instructions have a different CPI

- Example
    - Computer A: Cycle Time = 250 ps, CPI = 2.0
    - Computer B: Cycle Time = 500ps, CPI = 1.2

    - They have the same ISA

    CPU Time A = IC * 2.0 * 250 ps
    CPU Time B = IC * 1.2 * 500 ps

    A is faster, by how much?

    CPU Time B / CPU Time A = 600 / 500 = 1.2 Time Faster

- CPI in more detail
    Clock Cycles = Sum over all instruction classes(CPI for this class *
                                                    Instruciton Count for this class)

CPU Time = Instructions / Program * Clock Cycles / Instruction * Seconds / Clock Cycles
