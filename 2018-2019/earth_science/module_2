2a:
    Galaxies:
        systems of composed of hundreds of billions of stars

        each containing an average of 200 billion starts

        these galaxies tend to cluster:
            rich clusters contain more than 1000 galizies, mostly eliptical,
            crowded at the center

            poor clusters contain less than 100 galaxies, usually irregularly
            shapped, less concentrated in the center

            super clusters are groups of multiple clusters

        If we look at the overall placement of galaxies, we see they are not
        randomly distributed

        The virgo supercluster is one of many but is very important because it
        includes the local group - a very important concept
            out galaxy is a part of this local group


        Milky Way:
            barred spiral galaxy

            estimated to contain over 100 billion starts, 100000 light years
            across, 1000 light years thick

            takes 225 million years for the milky way to make one complete
            revolutiono

        our solar system
            8 planets, over 100 moons

            all of the planets rotate in the same direction, most moons orbit
            the planets they orbit in the same direction that the planet orbits
            the sun

            also meteroroids, asteroids and commets that follow orbits around
            the sun

    Gravity and the solar system:
        Newton's first law of motion:
            objects in motion remain in motion, and objects at rest remain at
            rest unless acted upon by some outside force

        Since planets change both speed and direction, we know there is some
        force acting on them - gravity
            the centrifugal force oposes gravity when a planet is in motion, it
            is the force poitning outwards in a rotating system



    Solar Nebula Theory:
        The suns, planets and all other objects formed from giant clouds of gas
        called the solar nebula

        we can assume the composition of this nebula

        this giant cloud of gas and dust started to collapse gravitationally,
        it flattened into a rotating disk and formed a protosun

        sun undergoes gravitational contraction until fusion eventually starts.

        Among the remaning objects, they all entered repeated collisions that
        formed planetismals

        these bodies continually rammed into eachother and formed protoplannets
        the gas plannets formed first, then eventually the inner rocky planets

    Origin of the early planets:
        the inner 4 (though all were) were all extremley hot.  The heat was due
        to the collisions of the planetesimals, compression of planets and
        distigration of radioactive materials

        
        The accretion of the inner plannets was fast:
            heat was enormous, over 2000C
            Softening and melting of early planets causesed differentation
            (seperation and migration) of heavy and light elements based on
            densities

        The Gasesous planets formed around rocky cores:
            when they reached about 10-15x the mass of earth they pulled in a
            bunch of gas

        4 inner planets:
            they were internally seperated into many layers based on the
            densities of materials.

        Early Earth:
            hit by a large mars sized object 4.5 BY ago

            The material thrown off of earth formed the moon

            the moon:
                started off very hot, covered by a magma ocean
                it eventually crystalized minerals

                the moon probably has a metalic core.
                once the moon solidified, it was bombarded by meteors and
                formed all of the impact cretors we see

                was originally very close to the earth, but slowly drifted away

            Earth:
                was also covered by a magma ocean early on.  The magma
                crystalized

                earth cooled eventually and solidified.  Many trapped iner
                gasses formed the early atmosphere and the early oceans


    Our solar system today:
        The inner 4 are called the terrestrial planets

        the orbits are all eliptical

        terrestrial planets:
            closest to the sun

            all quite similar

            generally small, rocky bodies with densities greater than 3gm/cm^3

            composed mainly of silicates:
                things that contain mostly silicon and oxygen

            volcanically active:
                forms basaltic rock - very common in the solar system

    mercury:
        revolves around the sun once every 88 
        rotates at around 176 earth days per rotation

        temperature extremes from -173 to 427 C

    Venus:
        very thick atmosphere of mostly carbon dioxide

        atmos[heric pressure of more than 90x Earth

        Clouds of sulfuric acid

        surface temp of 450C

        Internal layer simmilar to earth

        radar images of surface of venus find:
            volcanoes
            vast volcanic planes
            basalitic lava flows
            mountain ranges
            deep rift valleys

    Mars:
        half diameter of earth

        takes 687 earth days to resolve aroud the sun

        -149 at poles to 20 C at equator

        very thin atmosphere

        has largest volcanoes and valleys

        very prominant canyons that look very simmilar to early water ways

        ancient life on mars?
            snc meteorites that are martian in origin

            they look as if there is microscopic fossil bacteria

        ROvers:
            7 in total

            Curitosity is the most recent

2b:
    Asteroid Belt:
        Asteroids are rocky bodies, thought to be planetesimal debris
        up to 1000 km in diameter, though most are less than 100km in diameter

        Nasa suspects thare are ~980 alrger than 1km in diameter that could
        destroy civilization

        Asteroids and commets have hit earth many times in the past:
        
    Jovian PLanets (giant planets):
        much different from the terrestrial plannets

        each has a solid rocky core, surrounded by frozen or liquid gases
        multiple moons
        impressive ring systems

        Jupiter:
            we can visualize the atmosphere:
                the light bands are clouds where the atmosphere is rising
                dark bands are places where the atmosphere is sinking

                there are strong horizontal winds that are responsible for
                dividing the atmosphere into these small bands

            The great red spot:
                great storm that has been going on for centuries

                larger than 3 earths

            Has over 60 known moons:
                IO, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto

                We have seen a volcanic eruption on IO, thought to have
                balsatic lava flows and many sulfur filled gasses?

                Europa has an icy surface, due to tidal stresses

        Saturn:
            2nd largest

            something around 53 named moons, along with the impressive rings
            each of the rings are composed of dust along with ice

            Titan:
                has liquid methane, possibly oceans of methane

        Uranus:
            The ice planet
            rotates on its side, and has a prominant ring system

            methane rich atmosphere, mantle of watter

        Neptune:
            super high wind speeds

            dark spots that are thought to be storms

            13 known moons

        Kuiper Belt:
            small bodies including pluto

            Horizon Space Craft:
                took images of pluto and its moons
                
                going into the kuiper belt

        Oort Cloud:
            comments are thought to spawn from here, beyond the kuiper belt

        Comets:
            basically dirty snow balls
                
            some may contain organic material

            thought to be relicts of early solar nebula, swept to the far
            reachers of the solar system

            Rosetta Space craft:
                launched in 2004, reached comet 67P august, 2014

        The Sun:
            gets its energy from thermo nuclear fusion from within the core of
            the sun

                four hydrogen atoms fuse to form on helium, releasing energy in
                the process

                requires extremley high temperatures, gravity in the sun causes
                this to occur

            EM Spectrum considering sun:
                hot object emits radiation over a wide range of wavelength

                the intensity of the radiation, is not the same for all
                wavelength

                the wavelength of greatest intensity is a function of
                theobjects temp and can be calculated with Wien's law

                Imax = 3000000 / T (nm)
