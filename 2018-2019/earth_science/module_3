3a:
    The stratosphere
        temp increases with altitude:
            this is because the stratoshere absorbs uv light from the sun
            protects us from UV

        ozone production:
            starts with o2
            UV light will split that into 2 oxygen atoms
            one of the combines with another o2 to form the ozone modcule

        ozone destruction:
            o3 will interact with uv light and it will be split into o2 and o
            the single oxygen can react and combine with another singleton

        ozone creation is much more common


        in the atmosphere is produced by natural processes

        ozone depletion:
            in sep-oct there is a depletion of ozone in the polar regions

            causes:
                high energy particles from solar flares

                volcanic gasses and ash particles react with ozone and break it
                doen

                release of CFCs by humans into atmosphere
                    discovered in 1974

                    produced by AC, foam and aerosol sprays 

                    a single chlorine atom is capable of destroying as many as
                    10000 ozone atoms

                Formation of artantic ozone home:
                    CFC's produced in the northern hemisphere are transported
                    southward by atmospheric winds over antartica

                    during the antartic winer, 
                        strong westernly winds start to circulate aaround the
                        continenet creating a vortex that traps and chills the
                        air

                        forms ice and traps compounds

           
                    during the antartic spring:
                        the emurging sunlightdrives photochemical reactions
                        that releases compounds

                        the chlorine will form interactions and destroy ozone



    THe mesopshere:
        50 km to 80 km above earth

        temperature decreases in the mesosphere,because of decreasing influence
        of ozone

        does not absorb any significant radiation


    The thermoshere:
        80km above earth

        temp increases upward beause of interactions with solar winds
            results in ionization of the atmosphere

            resulting in the ionozhpere

        near the poles, the earth's magnetic field produces the auroras in the
        ionosphere


        multiple lyers:
            D layer:
                bottom layer
                absorbs am radio waves

                disappears at night, e and f layers will bounce waves back to
                the surface



    Earth's atmosphere and effect on EM spectrum
        gamma and x rays are stopped by ionosphere

        uv radiation is mostly absorbed by the ozone layer

        both visable and infared make it all the way to the surface
            re emmitted back into the atmosphere as infared radiation

    Energy atmosphere system
        energy atmosphere systems have inputs:
            solar energy and its interaction with earth's atmosphere

        actions:
            energy balance

        human earth realtions:
            polllution
            acid decomposition
            heat index, wind chill

        outputs:
            global temperatures

            wind and ocean currents

        energy pathways:
            incoming solar radiation is effeted by the atmosphere:
                scattering:
                    changing direction without altering wavelength

                refraction:
                    change in speed and direction, light path bends

                    can cause double images and shit because of the bending
                    light
