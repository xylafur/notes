3a:
    The stratosphere
        temp increases with altitude:
            this is because the stratoshere absorbs uv light from the sun
            protects us from UV

        ozone production:
            starts with o2
            UV light will split that into 2 oxygen atoms
            one of the combines with another o2 to form the ozone modcule

        ozone destruction:
            o3 will interact with uv light and it will be split into o2 and o
            the single oxygen can react and combine with another singleton

        ozone creation is much more common


        in the atmosphere is produced by natural processes

        ozone depletion:
            in sep-oct there is a depletion of ozone in the polar regions

            causes:
                high energy particles from solar flares

                volcanic gasses and ash particles react with ozone and break it
                doen

                release of CFCs by humans into atmosphere
                    discovered in 1974

                    produced by AC, foam and aerosol sprays 

                    a single chlorine atom is capable of destroying as many as
                    10000 ozone atoms

                Formation of artantic ozone home:
                    CFC's produced in the northern hemisphere are transported
                    southward by atmospheric winds over antartica

                    during the antartic winer, 
                        strong westernly winds start to circulate aaround the
                        continenet creating a vortex that traps and chills the
                        air

                        forms ice and traps compounds

           
                    during the antartic spring:
                        the emurging sunlightdrives photochemical reactions
                        that releases compounds

                        the chlorine will form interactions and destroy ozone



    THe mesopshere:
        50 km to 80 km above earth

        temperature decreases in the mesosphere,because of decreasing influence
        of ozone

        does not absorb any significant radiation


    The thermoshere:
        80km above earth

        temp increases upward beause of interactions with solar winds
            results in ionization of the atmosphere

            resulting in the ionozhpere

        near the poles, the earth's magnetic field produces the auroras in the
        ionosphere


        multiple lyers:
            D layer:
                bottom layer
                absorbs am radio waves

                disappears at night, e and f layers will bounce waves back to
                the surface



    Earth's atmosphere and effect on EM spectrum
        gamma and x rays are stopped by ionosphere

        uv radiation is mostly absorbed by the ozone layer

        both visable and infared make it all the way to the surface
            re emmitted back into the atmosphere as infared radiation

    Energy atmosphere system
        energy atmosphere systems have inputs:
            solar energy and its interaction with earth's atmosphere

        actions:
            energy balance

        human earth realtions:
            polllution
            acid decomposition
            heat index, wind chill

        outputs:
            global temperatures

            wind and ocean currents

        energy pathways:
            incoming solar radiation is effeted by the atmosphere:
                scattering:
                    changing direction without altering wavelength

                refraction:
                    change in speed and direction, light path bends

                    can cause double images and shit because of the bending
                    light

                reflection:
                    energy that bounces off and is returned
                        about 21 percent of inbound radiation is reflected

                        about 7 % is refracted

                    The reflective quality of the Earths surface is called
                    Albedo:
                        Darker colors have lower albedos (less reflective)

                        Lighter Colors have higher albedos (more reflective)


                        Clouds have a profound effect:
                            incoming shortwave radiation is reflected back
                            towards space

                            industrial aerosols can also refect incoming
                            radiation

                            this results in the earth cooling

                            Cloud greenhouse forcing:
                                clouds act to increase greenhouse warming

                                they will stop escape of longwave radiation
                                emitted by earth's surface

                                this warm's earth surface

                            clouds and forcing:
                                the height of the wave depends on greenhouse
                                forcing or albedo

                                high clouds result in net greenhouse forcing
                                and atmospheric warming

                                low clouds result in net albedo forcing, most
                                of the imcoming short wave is reflected back
                                into space

            Absorption:
                assemilation of radiation and conversion from one form to
                another
                    can occur in gasses, dust, clouds and ozone

                    can be absorbed by photosynthesis

                    increases the temp of the absorbing surface

            Heat Transfer:
                when short wave rad penetrates through the atmosphere and is
                absorbed by earth stuff, heat transfer can ccur:
                    convection in atmosphere:
                        horizonal transfer of heat in atmospehere

                    conduction:
                        occurs within surface soil and rock

                    latent heat transfer:
                        by way of evaporation of water

                    atmosphereic radiation:
                        greenhouse effect

                Greenhouse effect:
                    atmospheric warming

                    Much of the incoming short wave penetrates the atmosphere,
                    many things on earth also release short wave

                    greenhouse gases absorb outgonig long wavelength radiation
                    and radiate some of this energy earthward
                        this traps heat in the lower atmosphere

            All solar radiation recieved by the surface is eventually released
            back into space

3b:
    Heat and Heat Storage:
        Sensible Heat
            heat that we sense of feel

            determined by heat capacity of a substance

        Latent Heat
            heat that is absorbed or released due to phase changes

        When you heat a substance, that thing holds heat by getting how
            somethings can store more heat than others

        Net Radiation:
            since earth is a curved shperoid we have that imbalance of net
            radiation

            positive values at low latitudes, mmeaning there is an energy
            surplus.  The equator recieves more radiaion than it radiates back

            negative values poleward

            net result is that the energy surplus is transported pole ward

            causing circulation in atmosphere in oceans


            Surface energy balance:
                surface revieves visable shortwave and logwave radiation

                also reflects visable and longwave radiation


            net radiation is highest in the middle of the day and lowest during
            the night

            after heating a non vegetated surface, the surface gradually
            decreases via three pathways of heat removeal:
                sensible heat within the bedrock is drawn to the ground surface
                via conduction

                atmospheric convection removes sensible heat from the surface
                via rising air masses

                through latent heat of evaporation

        Urban Heat Islands:
            temperature in urban areas are hotter than nearby rural areas

            the surfaces in urban areas are less reflective

            irregular gemoetric shapes

            human activity

            water does not reach the soil, there is more runoff

            air pollution absorbes more thermal energy

        Princpal Temperature Controls
            Latitude:
                affects insolation (more diffuse at higher latitudes)

            altitude:
                higher altitude has greater daily range
                high altitude has lower annual average

            cloud cover:
                high albedo

                moderates termpaeratures

        Land Water Heating Differences:
            Evaporation and latent heat:
                84% of evaporation on earth is in the oceans
                    when things evaporate there is heat loss
                    this moderates termpaeratures

            Transparency:
                    solid ground is opace and absorbes energy
                ground surface is heater
                    accumulated energy is rapidly lost at night


                water is transparent and transmits light
                    heat is distributed among much greater depths

            Specific Heat
                Water has a higher specific heat
                    temps take longer to change

                Land has a lower specific heat:
                    temps cahnge quickly

            Movement:
                land is rigid and solid, water moves

                water can thus mix different temperatures much easier

            Oceans moderate atmospheric temperatures from negative feedback
                increasing ovean temps results in more clouds

                lower surface ocean temperatures removes cloud cover and leads
                to more solar radiation


    Air temp and the human body:
        wind chill:
            correlates cold and wind speed

        heat index:
            correlates heat and humidity
