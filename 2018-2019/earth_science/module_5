Water, Weather, and Climate Systems

5a:
    Water:
        Three Phases of Water:
            occurs in all 3 phases under earth's surface conditions

            sublimination:
                direct change from ice to vapor or other way around

        polar, so bonds well together

        Humidity:
            Speicific Humidity:
                g of water vapor /kg of air

                air can hold more water vapor the hotter it is, it is not
                hotter though, it is a parabolic relationship.

                Air can hold increasingly more and more water per temperature
                unit increase

                more water is required to saturate warmer air

            relative humidity:
                expressed in percent

                mass of water in air * 100 / mass of water air can hold

                so if air cools it has a higher relative humidity if it still
                has the same ammoutn of vapor in the air

            dew point
                temp at which water vapor will begin to condense


            wet bulb/ driy bulb:
                way to determine dew point of air

                start with a thermometer and measure the temp of the air, we
                get the dry bul temp

                then we take another thermometer and wrap it in a moist cloth,
                this is called the wet bulb temperature

                the wet bulb temp is lower because the wet sponge is undergoing
                envarporation and releasing latent heat

                The difference between these two temperatures will give us the
                dewpoint

            vapor pressure:
                ammount of pressure exerted by vapor in the atmosphere

                given in milibars

                as more vapor is in the atmosphere, the ammount of pressure
                exerted by that water vapor increases

                when that point is reached, no more water can be added to the
                atmosphere

                because warmer air can hold more water, warmer air can exert
                more vapor pressure

        Atmospheric Stability:
            air parcel = packet of air, like a baloon or something

            differences in temp create changes in density:
                warmer air has lower density where as cold air has higher

            two opposing forces work on a parcel of air:
                upward buoyancy force
                downward gravitational force

            a parcel of lower density air will rise (be more boyant) while
            higher density will not (less boyant)

            adiabatic Processes:
                warming and cooling of a parcel of air are termed adiabatic:
                    an ascending air parcel cools by expansion in reponse to
                    reduced pressure at higher altitudes

                pressure decreases in this process, it will also cool in the
                process
                    so if we release a baloon at the surface where the
                    atmospheric pressure is maximum and the baloon is warmer
                    than the surrounding air (meaning its less dense)

                    as it rises towards higher altitudes, there is decreasing
                    pressure, it expands as a result during this process

                    this is refered to cooling by expansion

                Adiabatic Rates:
                    Dry adiabatic rate:
                        rate at which dry air cools by expansion or heats by
                        compression

                    moist adiabatic rate:
                        rate at which ascending air that is moiset cools by
                        expansion

                        usually lower than dry rate

                        beause latent heat of condensation in moist air is
                        liberated as sensible heat

                Adiabatic Cooling:
                    air parcel asscending undergoing adiabatic expanding and
                    cooling
