4a: The Energy Atmosphere System
    air pressure:
        measure using a barometer


    driving forces of the atmosphere
        gravity
        pressure gradient force
            created from pressure difference among locations on earth

            winds tend to move from high to low pressure


        coriolis Force
            since earth is a sphere and rotates on its axis, wind across the
            surface appears to curve

            different directions in hemisphere:
                right in north, left in south

            the winds are moving in a straight line but the seem to curve
            because the earth is rotating, changing the distance from the wind
            to the surface or wherever

            
        Friction Force
            effects of friction on/from wind
            mainly acts near earth's surface
            500m above earth's surface

            variables affecting:
                surface texture
                wind speed
                time of day and year 
                atmospheric conditions

            near surface, friction distrupts equillibrium between pressure
            gradient and coriolis forces, causing:
                generates cyclones
                cyclones

            pressure and coriolis can form wind circles following isobars:
                when you add the frictional force into the mix, these wind
                circles will start to spin inward towards low pressure areas

    Winds and Isobars:
        ways of mreasuring areas of different pressures, like a topographic map
        but for pressure systems

        lines have equal pressure
        
        the closer together isobar lines, the stronger the wind

    wind in high pressure area will sink
    will rise in low pressure, helps with things converging to low pressure
    areas
