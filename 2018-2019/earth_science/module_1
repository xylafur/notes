1a:
    Induction and Deduction:
        induction comes from just observations, a generalization

        A deduction is what we deduce from these observations, our hypothesis

        repeated verification of a hypothesis results in a theory.
        a theory is well tested and widely accepted, however thories must be
        testable and falsifiable

    All theories are considered provisional:
        theories are more or less the end points of science

    Earth system views earth as a planet tbat is small and self contained
        earth has multiple spheres that interact with eachother in cycles

        Biosphere (all living things), atmosphere (gas), hydrosphere (water),
        cryosphere (glacieres), lithospere (tectonics and vulcanism)

            The carbon cycle is a way for the bioshpere to interact with the
            atmosphere

        Earth Cycle:
            simply a continuous process under which matter and materials are
            ciculated or recycled throughout the earth

            reppetitions that recur, sometimes of specified periods

            Matter and materials are transfered fro one reservoir to another
            and are sometimes changed in the process

            The hydrologic cycle:
                the way water moves though our plant
                we see water continaed in resivours (clouts, glaciers, flowing
                water [streams, rivers], and oveans [ocean currents], groud
                water)

                This looks at how water is transfered from one resivour to
                another

            Rock Cycle:
                The loop that illistrates how one rock type can change into
                other types of rocks

                weathering on the surface breaks rock into sediment, currents
                like wind and water will transport the sediment to different
                locations where it accumulates.  At this point in the rock
                cycle, it can interact by the hydrologic cycle.
                The sediment is burried and then cemented together to form
                sedimentary rocks.  At higher temps deeper metamorphic rocks
                are formed.  These rocks are either raised to the surface and
                then converted into sediment again.  Or it can be converted
                into igneous through magma and possibly become sediment again
                that way

            Earth systems are powered by heat enginges:
                converts heat energy into kinetic energy

                Earth's external heat engine is powered by the sun

                But earth also has an internal heat engine that is poweredby
                the geothermal head in the core of earth

2a:
    Earth Heat Engines:
        Earths external heat engine drives the water and rock cycles

        Earth's Internal heat engine drives plate tectonics and the internal
        heat engine

    Earth as a System:
        We are to study earth as a dynamic planet with interacting parts or
        spheres

        Wat is a system?
            Any size group of interacting parts that forms a complex whole

            Comprises any number of subsystems or cycles

            energy can be transformed from one type to another (potential to
            kinetic for example)

            Open system:
                both energy and matter flow into the system

                Example (Car):
                    inputs: energy and matter (oil, gas, tires, etc)
                    actions: energy and material conversions and storage
                    outputs: exaust gases, heat energy, mechanical motion, etc

                Example (leaf):
                    inputs: sunlight, co2, h20
                    actions: photosynthesis
                    outputs: oxygen, water

                    During the night, plants basically do the opposite.  The
                    sugars created are consumed.

                    The forest is therfore an overall open system

                Example (ocean):
                    input: radiation, percipitation
                    output: latent heat, water vapor

            Closed system:
                system is shut off from the surrounding enviornment

                Energy and matter does not enter or leave the system

            Earth is an open system for energy, but a closed system for matter
                even though this isn't completley true, its true enough


        Time scales of interactions:
            atmosphere:
                seconds or days
                think about weather

            oceans:
                hours to centuries
                currents and such

            Earth:
                earthquakes and volcanoes, seconds to days

                movement of continents: millions of years

        Forces and processes affecting earth's materials
            gravity from sun and moon
            atmospheric pressure
            sun's energy
            wind and ocean currents
            gravity from earth

        Atmosphere and earth's surface:
            blocks some light and UV
            Energy that reaches the surface hits the land and the sea and can
            be converted into infared which eventually leaks back into space

            Water vapor in the atmosphere eventually returns the ocean from the
            hydroogic cycle


        Earth systems are quite complex, and create these overall cycles

    Feedback mechanisms:
        negative feedback:
            maintains the status quo
            a change in the system triggers one of more mechanisms that goes
            towards reversing that change

            example:
                as clout formation increases, the earth's overall reflection is
                changed.  Clounds increase the reflectivity of the earths
                atmosphere, keeping some of the radiation from hitting earth's
                surface.  This results in lower temperatures.  This leads to
                less evaporation, which eventually leads to less clouds and
                less percipitation, leading to fewer clounds in the atmosphere,
                acusing more solar energy being absorbed by the earth's
                surface, surface temp increases slightly, then there is
                increased evaporation in the oceans

        Positive Feedback mechanism:
            enhances or drives changes
            something happens that causes it to happen more

        System equilibrium:
            most systems matintain structure and character over time

            Rates of inputs and outputs in the system are more or less euqal
            over time.  Amounts of energy and matter in storage are constant or
            fluctuate around a stable average

            systems try to resist change, but can meet a threshold beyond which
            it can nolonger maintain character such as
                abrupt landslide
                sudden collaps
                extinction of species


                the system can hit a tipping point and then adjust to a new
                normal

    Earth Systems:
        incolve the dynamic interaction of 3 components:
            mass
            energy
            time
            
        interaction over time between:
            mass:
                chemisty is used to determine compositions and properties

            energy:
                physics is used to trace the transfer of energy

        variables:
            pressure, temperature, volume, composition, density, heat, heat
            capacity and force

            mass:
                can be defineied as the messure of the quantity of matter in a
                body, typically in grams

                mass of an object is measured relative to the mass of a known
                object

1c:
    Energy and Heat:
        again, 2 differnet energy sources, internal and external

        external because of radioactive decay:
            drives rock and tectonic cycles

        2 types of heat:
            sensible heat:
                heat that we sense

            latent heat:
                heat that is aborbed or released due to phase change

                if we heat a beaker of ice, we first see sensible heat seeing
                temperature rise, then when the ice begins to melt we enter the
                phase of latent heat

            transfer of heat:
                conduction:
                    holding a metal strip over a flame

                    molecules on the hot end vibrate rapidly, heat is
                    transfered between colisions of the rapid and slow atoms
                    
                convection 
                    movement of material due to temperature differences

                    happens in the mantle, hotter regions will rise and cooler
                    regions will sink, creating a cycle


                radiation:
                    in discrete bundles of photons or electromagnetic waves

            properties emwaves
                reflecting:
                    bouncing

                refracting:
                    bending of waves when it changes between surfaces

                diffraction:
                    breaking of a ray of light into colors of the spectrum
            
        
    remotesensing:
        measureing wavelengths emmitted by materials

        measure radiation that is absorbed and emitted from earth
        materials

        instrucments can measure a certain narrow band of em waves.
    
        active:
            blast a beam of radiation and analyze the energy that comes
            back

            passive:
                just analyze what comes from the surface

            landsat:
                study changes of a landscape over time

        GIS: (geographic information systems)
            software for gathering, manipulating and analyzing geographic info

            individual maps displaying different features for the same area can
            be constructed in layers

            layers can be overlain to form a composit map

    Variation in gravity:
        sea level is not uniform everywhere, this is because gravity is not the
        same every where

        THis is due to different densities of differnet materials


        Geoid:
            representation of sea level:
                distorted relative to the gravity and rotation
