Dynamic Planet

a_1:
    We will begin looking at the solid earth, beginning with the interior

    Earth has an internal heat engine - some of the processes contributing to
    this heat engine are:
        - head released by coliding particles during formation of earth
        - heat released during gravitational contraction of the early earth
        - heat emitted by radioactive decay of unstable isotopes within earth
        - early impact with protomoon
        - as iron crystalized to form solid iron core

    Now we go back to the formation of thea earth - after collisions of
    planetesimals and such

    Because earth and other early planets were very hot:
        the hot softened interiors allowed migration of materials based on
        density.

        The denser material such as iron settled to the core while lighter
        material settled to the surface
            this is reponsible for the internal layering of the planet

    Soon after impact with proto moon:
        Earth was covered by a magma ocean that was hundreds if not thousands
        of km deep

        over time the ocean cooled and formed the mantle capped with the crust
        on the top

        Young earth as we said was very hot from collisions and decay of
        radioactive isotopes

        over time the earth gradually cooled to its present state - four and a
        half billion years after first formation
            the mantle and crust contain long lived radioactive isotopes that
            continue to decay and keep our planet from becoming an iceball
                this includes uranium, thorium, potassium which all have
                halflives of millions to billions of years

    Earth's internal layers:
        going bottom to top
        Inner core:
            Iron sank to the very bottom, forming the inner core

        Outer core

        Lower mantle 

        upper mantle

        asthenosphere

        lithosphere
        
        crust


    Study of solid earth:
        difficult to study the earth's interior
            we can drill down a few kilometers into earth's crust

            geophysical surveys can determine what is underneath though

        methods of exploring subsurface:
            uplifting
                techtonic properties can bring deeper rocks up to the
                surface

            rocks above 5km

            drilling

            magma can bring up pieces of deeper rocks

            geophysical surveys:
                seismic-reflection data

                electrical surveys
                    good way to study ground water

                magnetic data
                    airial surveys

                gravity data



        investigating deep processes:
            we can study rocks with deep origins

            we can use computer models based on seismic refraction data

            we can replicte deep conditions in the lab
                take rocks and subject them to high pressure and temps

            Seismic Waves:
                tectonic forces can cause crust and lithosphere to break along
                faults

                slippage releases energy as seismic waves
                    create vibrations known as earthquakes

                site of initial fault slippage is caled the hypocenter (focus)
                point on the surface above the focus is called the epicenter

                there are wave fronts that propigate from the hypocenter
                seismograph:
                    instruments that measue vibrations in the ground
                    
                    several instruments:
                        one for up and down
                        one east west
                        one north south



                3 groups
                    (P)rimary waves
                        travel the fastest, get to the seismograph first

                        average velocity of 5km/s
                        travel though all mediums

                        propogates like a slinky - a series of compressions and
                        expansions

                    (S)econdary waves
                        second to be recorded by the seismograph

                        travel half the speed of P waves

                        push material at right angles.

                        Wave move like a wave propogating though a rope.
                            the wave peak is perpindicular to the propogation
                            of the wave

                        canot travel though liquid

                        
                    surface waves
                        slowest and arrive last

                        slightly slower than s wave.  SImilar to waves in the
                        ocean

                        a few types:
                            travels like rolling ocean waves

                            side to side motion
                                damaging to buildings

                We can create rays that intersect the waves perpindicular from
                every direction
                    to follow the wave through the earth we follow a single ray

                    waves get both reflected and refracted!
                        we lose some energy because the wave is split

                    when the wave encounters a material of different type the
                    wave gets both reflected and refracted.
                        its basically snells law from physics

                    when wave gets faster the ray bends towards the
                    intersection

                    when the wave slows down it builds more towards the normal
                    of the intersection


            Seismic study show that the continental crust is quite a bit
            thicker than oceanic crust
                Crust:
                    continental
                        less dense (more buoyant)

                    oceanic

                Upper mantle:
                    Lithosphere:
                        cool rigid layer
                        
                        averages about 100km thick, but can be up to 250 km
                        thick

                        broken into a series of plates

                    asthenosphere:
                        just below the lithosphere

                        contains softed peridotite which is known as the low
                        velocity zone - this is where seismic waves will slow
                        down

                        as we get lower this peridotite becomes solid again

                    Upper Transition Zone: 400 km depth
                        olivine changes to a spiral crystal structure
                            stable under lower pressures, becomes much more
                            dense

                            this causes s and p waves to increase in velocity

                    Lower transition Zone: 670 km
                        spinel crystal tructure comes even more tightly packed,
                        which causes another increase in the velocity of s and
                        p waves

            P waves can change to S waves - this is how we get S waves through
            the inner core even though they can't pass though liquid, and thus
            the liquid outer core
