2a:
    Galaxies:
        systems of composed of hundreds of billions of stars

        each containing an average of 200 billion starts

        these galaxies tend to cluster:
            rich clusters contain more than 1000 galizies, mostly eliptical,
            crowded at the center

            poor clusters contain less than 100 galaxies, usually irregularly
            shapped, less concentrated in the center

            super clusters are groups of multiple clusters

        If we look at the overall placement of galaxies, we see they are not
        randomly distributed

        The virgo supercluster is one of many but is very important because it
        includes the local group - a very important concept
            out galaxy is a part of this local group


        Milky Way:
            barred spiral galaxy

            estimated to contain over 100 billion starts, 100000 light years
            across, 1000 light years thick

            takes 225 million years for the milky way to make one complete
            revolutiono

        our solar system
            8 planets, over 100 moons

            all of the planets rotate in the same direction, most moons orbit
            the planets they orbit in the same direction that the planet orbits
            the sun

            also meteroroids, asteroids and commets that follow orbits around
            the sun

    Gravity and the solar system:
        Newton's first law of motion:
            objects in motion remain in motion, and objects at rest remain at
            rest unless acted upon by some outside force

        Since planets change both speed and direction, we know there is some
        force acting on them - gravity
            the centrifugal force oposes gravity when a planet is in motion, it
            is the force poitning outwards in a rotating system



    Solar Nebula Theory:
        The suns, planets and all other objects formed from giant clouds of gas
        called the solar nebula

        we can assume the composition of this nebula

        this giant cloud of gas and dust started to collapse gravitationally,
        it flattened into a rotating disk and formed a protosun

        sun undergoes gravitational contraction until fusion eventually starts.

        Among the remaning objects, they all entered repeated collisions that
        formed planetismals

        these bodies continually rammed into eachother and formed protoplannets
        the gas plannets formed first, then eventually the inner rocky planets

    Origin of the early planets:
        the inner 4 (though all were) were all extremley hot.  The heat was due
        to the collisions of the planetesimals, compression of planets and
        distigration of radioactive materials

        
        The accretion of the inner plannets was fast:
            heat was enormous, over 2000C
            Softening and melting of early planets causesed differentation
            (seperation and migration) of heavy and light elements based on
            densities

        The Gasesous planets formed around rocky cores:
            when they reached about 10-15x the mass of earth they pulled in a
            bunch of gas

        4 inner planets:
            they were internally seperated into many layers based on the
            densities of materials.

        Early Earth:
            hit by a large mars sized object 4.5 BY ago

            The material thrown off of earth formed the moon

            the moon:
                started off very hot, covered by a magma ocean
                it eventually crystalized minerals

                the moon probably has a metalic core.
                once the moon solidified, it was bombarded by meteors and
                formed all of the impact cretors we see

                was originally very close to the earth, but slowly drifted away

            Earth:
                was also covered by a magma ocean early on.  The magma
                crystalized

                earth cooled eventually and solidified.  Many trapped iner
                gasses formed the early atmosphere and the early oceans


    Our solar system today:
        The inner 4 are called the terrestrial planets

        the orbits are all eliptical

        terrestrial planets:
            closest to the sun

            all quite similar

            generally small, rocky bodies with densities greater than 3gm/cm^3

            composed mainly of silicates:
                things that contain mostly silicon and oxygen

            volcanically active:
                forms basaltic rock - very common in the solar system

    mercury:
        revolves around the sun once every 88 
        rotates at around 176 earth days per rotation

        temperature extremes from -173 to 427 C

    Venus:
        very thick atmosphere of mostly carbon dioxide

        atmos[heric pressure of more than 90x Earth

        Clouds of sulfuric acid

        surface temp of 450C

        Internal layer simmilar to earth

        radar images of surface of venus find:
            volcanoes
            vast volcanic planes
            basalitic lava flows
            mountain ranges
            deep rift valleys

    Mars:
        half diameter of earth

        takes 687 earth days to resolve aroud the sun

        -149 at poles to 20 C at equator

        very thin atmosphere

        has largest volcanoes and valleys

        very prominant canyons that look very simmilar to early water ways

        ancient life on mars?
            snc meteorites that are martian in origin

            they look as if there is microscopic fossil bacteria

        ROvers:
            7 in total

            Curitosity is the most recent

2b:
    Asteroid Belt:
        Asteroids are rocky bodies, thought to be planetesimal debris
        up to 1000 km in diameter, though most are less than 100km in diameter

        Nasa suspects thare are ~980 alrger than 1km in diameter that could
        destroy civilization

        Asteroids and commets have hit earth many times in the past:

    Jovian PLanets (giant planets):
        much different from the terrestrial plannets

        each has a solid rocky core, surrounded by frozen or liquid gases
        multiple moons
        impressive ring systems

        Jupiter:
            we can visualize the atmosphere:
                the light bands are clouds where the atmosphere is rising
                dark bands are places where the atmosphere is sinking

                there are strong horizontal winds that are responsible for
                dividing the atmosphere into these small bands

            The great red spot:
                great storm that has been going on for centuries

                larger than 3 earths

            Has over 60 known moons:
                IO, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto

                We have seen a volcanic eruption on IO, thought to have
                balsatic lava flows and many sulfur filled gasses?

                Europa has an icy surface, due to tidal stresses

        Saturn:
            2nd largest

            something around 53 named moons, along with the impressive rings
            each of the rings are composed of dust along with ice

            Titan:
                has liquid methane, possibly oceans of methane

        Uranus:
            The ice planet
            rotates on its side, and has a prominant ring system

            methane rich atmosphere, mantle of watter

        Neptune:
            super high wind speeds

            dark spots that are thought to be storms

            13 known moons

        Kuiper Belt:
            small bodies including pluto

            Horizon Space Craft:
                took images of pluto and its moons

                going into the kuiper belt

        Oort Cloud:
            comments are thought to spawn from here, beyond the kuiper belt

        Comets:
            basically dirty snow balls

            some may contain organic material

            thought to be relicts of early solar nebula, swept to the far
            reachers of the solar system

            Rosetta Space craft:
                launched in 2004, reached comet 67P august, 2014

        The Sun:
            gets its energy from thermo nuclear fusion from within the core of
            the sun

                four hydrogen atoms fuse to form on helium, releasing energy in
                the process

                requires extremley high temperatures, gravity in the sun causes
                this to occur

            EM Spectrum considering sun:
                hot object emits radiation over a wide range of wavelength

                the intensity of the radiation, is not the same for all
                wavelength

                the wavelength of greatest intensity is a function of
                theobjects temp and can be calculated with Wien's law

                Imax = 3000000 / T (nm)

                The suns radiation just happens to be most intense in the
                visible range, though it does output radiation for other
                wavelengths as well

            Sun's composition:
                Discovery:
                    Fraunhofer used a prisim for light dispersion

                    he found dark lines in the spectrum

                    these dark lines are vertain wavelengths coresponding to
                    elements in the sun that absorbs those

                    Kirchoff Iscovered that hot hydrogen gas emmitted the same
                    wavelengths that the sun blacked out in the dispersion

                We know that its 91% hydrogen and 8.9 Helium, the rest is
                basically everything up to iron


                Core of the sun is the site of thermonuclear reactions -
                hydrogen is being fused into helium

                    this emitted core energy travels towards the surface in the
                    radiation zone

                    beyond the radiation zone is the convective zone, gases
                    cool at different rates causing covection

                    beyond this is the photosphere, the visable part of the sun
                        the photosphere has granuals, this is due to the
                        differening temps of points in the convective zone

                    Above the photosphere is the Atmosphere:
                        Chromosphere: (lower part of atmosphere)
                            huge arcs of hot gas in magnetic fields

                        Corona: (upper atmosphere)
                            much hotter than the chromosphere

                        Solar flairs:
                            linked to hot spots:
                                cool, darker regions of cooler defresed and
                                anomalously magnetic areas

                                These hurl charged particles into space

                                sun spot activity tends to vary in cycles over
                                the course of 11 years

                            throw out highly charged particles known as solar
                            wind
                                differental rotation of the sun distorts the
                                produced magnetic field

                                blows out in all directions, but portion of it
                                that reaches earth is affected by earth's
                                magnetic field

                                aurora are the result of this

                                charged particles collect and allign within van
                                allen belts, producing electric currents:
                                    this interacts with the atmosphere and
                                    causes the aurora borealis

                                    oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere are
                                    excited by these currents, oxygen produces
                                    green and nitrogen produces red/purple

                        Earth's Energy Budget:
                            input from the sun is shortwave radiation:
                                UV, visable and shortwave infared

                            output longwage radiation:
                                such as thermal infared

                        Insolation:
                            radiation arriving at Earth's atmosphere and
                            surface

                            The solar constant is the average insolation
                            recieved at the thermopause of Earth's average
                            distabce from the sun

                            The earth only really recieves a small fraction of
                            solar energy from the upper atmosphere because of
                            defraction, reflection etc

                            Uneven distribution of insolation:
                                the equator recieves about 2.5x as much as the
                                poles

                                This is why the polar regions are so much
                                colder than say the equator: the solar rays are
                                much more dirrect at the equator

                            Global net radiation is the balance between
                            incoming shortwave and outgoing longwave radiation
                                input - outputs


        The sun and the moon
            The moon's rotation is pretty much synchronous with
            its revolution around the earth, we always see the
            same side




    Earth:
        Earth is rotated relative to the plane of the eclyptic, which is the
        reason for our seasons

        the rotational axis points towards the north star

        Solstice:
            tilt of the earth relative to the sun causes circle of illumination
            to exclude one of the polar regions
                winter sulstice: dec 21-22
                summer sulstice: june 21-22
                    the area north of the arctic circle during this time
                    experiences 24 hours of daylight

                    area south of arctic circle experiences 24 hours of
                    darkness

                    opposite for the winter sulstice

        Equinox:
            corespond with spring and fall

            cicle of illumination passes thorugh both poles:
                all locations on earth experience 12 hour days

        reasons for seasons:
            1: revolution
            2: rotation
            3: tilt
            4: axis parallelism
                axises are in fixed alignment with polaris directly overhead
                north pole

            5: sphericity:
                oblate spheroid to sun's parallel rays


2d:
    Earth's modern atmosphere

    Earth's first atmopshere was likely in plaec right after accretion, mostly
    hydrogen captured from the solar nebula by earth's gravity

    about 4.5 years ago the moon thing hit the earth and made the moon and blew
    off most of the atmosphere
        this left earth witha maga motion

        the otion reacted with watervapor, producing various gasses (though
        very posionous to us)
        eventually the magama cooled and formed the gas

        then the cooling of earth furthered developnet:
            outhassing bombarding meteorites

            outgassing of earths interior

            photochemical reactions with atmosphereic gasses and UV light from
            the sun

        Gass held heavier gasses near the surface (h20, co2, n2) while earths
        secondary atmosphere escaped into space

        water vapor eventually condensed from the cooling atmosphere and rained
        down on the surface
            this formed early oceans about 4.4 billion years ago


        early atmophere oontained alot of methane, ammonia, and water vapor
            this early atmosphere was exposed to a lot of uv light because
            there was no ozone layer

        Photo chemical reactions:
            dissociation of water vapor into hydrogen and oxygen with hydrogen
            escaping into space

            this newly formed oxygen reacted with methane to form carbo dioxide
            and water

            Oxygen reacted with ammonia to form nitrogen and water


            two sources of free oxygen in early atmosphere:
                phrotochemical dissocation:
                    eventually all of the methane and ammoniawere converted
                    into co2 and n2

                    excess oxygen started to accumulate as watervapor

                ancient photosynthetic cyanobacteria:
                    3.8-3.6 billion years ago

                    photosynthesis releases oxygen

    Early cyanobacterial:
        we can see mats in precambrian oceans in rocks
            they are called stromatolites

        earliest evidence of life on earth

        we see them mostly in australia
            though they at one time ruled the world



    After methane and ammonia dissappeared
        oxygen accumulates
        over time more and more oxygen appeared in the atmosphere

            aerobic bacteria appeared about 2 bullion yeats ago, sought oxygen
            poor enviornments

            stratosphereic ozon developed about 400 million years agoo


    atmosphereic composition of modern atmosphere:
        heterosphere
            outer atmosphere, beginning at about 80km, continuing into
            outerspace (less than 00.1% of out entire atmosphere)
            non uniform distrinbution of gasses

        homosphere
            extends from earth's surface to 80km

            atmosphereic pressure decreases with height
            uniform blend of gasses

            major components:
                N2, O2

                the remaning 1% is the rest of all the gasses:
                    co2, etc..

        at the surface atmosphereic pressure is relatively high, but as we go
        up it drops significantly


        we can further subdivide based on temperature characteristics
            at bottom we have the
            Troposhere:
                as we go up, temp starts to change alot, -50*C at the top of
                this region

            Stratosphere:
                temp inscreases with altitude in the stratosphere,
                -50C at the bottom, but 0C at the top

                tropopause:
                    boundary between stratosphere and mesosphere

            Mesosphere:
                temp again decreases, from 0C to -90C

                stratopause:
                    boundary between stratosphere and mesosphere

            Thermosphere:
                temp increase at higher altitudes

                mesopause


    The troposhere:
        extends from the earth's surface to the tropopase

        varies in thickness, thicher at the equator
            as atmosphere warms the troposhere expands

            tropopause is different depending on the temp (higher at equator)

        temp decreases with higher altitudes

        contains 80-90% of the atmosphere
            heated at the bottom, rising cool airs

            rais, snows and blows

        variable atrmospheric components:
            both natural and human generated gases, dusts, particles and
            chemicals

            aerosols like soot have produced dimming of sunlight reachine earth

            who estimates air pollution kills 4.3 million people worldwide?
                per year?

        human produced air pollution:
            anthropogenic pollution

            dust, soot, suspended pollution

            combutstion of fossil fuels

            photochemical smog reslting from the interaction between sunlight
            and combustion

            industrial smog

        natural factors affection air pollution:
            winds:
                gather and move pollutions

                can cause political tensions, for instance between canada and
                US

            local and regional landscaps:
                surroundings mountains and hills can form barriers with smog

        photochemical smog:
            smog results from interactrion with sunlight and combustion
            products

            major ait pollutiants:
                PAN

                ground level ozone

                nigrogen dioxide (produces nitric acid)

        co2 comes from many source:
            volcanoes,

            weathering and erosion of carbonate roks

            respiration

            burning of fossil fuels

        Clean Air Act:
            passed in 1970, cahnged in 1977 and 1990

            reduced carbon monoxide
            nitrogen oxides
            volatile organic compoiunds
            volatile organic compounds
            particulate matter
            lead
