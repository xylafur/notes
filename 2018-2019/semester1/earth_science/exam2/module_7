Comtinuing from the last video (pre climate change):
    Humid Subtropical Climate
        hot summers, mild winters

        maritime tropical air masses produce convectional showers over land
        during summer

        frontal activity with polar air masses in winter produce cyclonic storm
        tracks

        what we have in houston

    Marine West Coast Climates:
        warm to cool summers

        cyclonic systems form throughout the year

    Mediterranean:
        dry summers
            due to subtropical highs

        mild winters controlled by cyclonic storm tracks

        sanfransisco california is a good example

    Humid Continental CLimates:
        hot to warm summers, cold winter

        tropical air masses influence humid contininential moist all year and
        winter dry climates

        cyclonic storms all year

    subartic climate:
        cool summers, very cold winters

        dominated thoughout the year by continental air masses

    polar climates:
        tundras and icecaps / ice sheets

        polar tundra:
            high lattitudes and high elevations

            permafrost and ground ice conditions are common

            land is under continuous snow cover, 8-10 months 

            small plants during spring and short summer

            never warms above 10C

        Polar marine climates:
            no month averages below -7 C

        earth's ice sheets:
            perpetually frozen

            all months below freezing

            greenland and antartica

    Desert Climates:
        Arid Deserts
            dominated by subtropical high pressure
            tropical and subpropical are very hot
            mid latitudes are cold

        Semiarid Stepps (flat grasslands)
            tropical and subtropical are hot, dominated by high pressure

            mid latitude cold occurs poleward of 30 degrees latitude

            generally occur along the margins of hot arid deserts

Climate Change:
    climate is affected by many factors.  All of the spheres are involved

    global warming:
        key indicators of climate warming:
            increasing temps over land and oceans
                as well as within troposphere

            increasing ocean heat

            melting sea ice

            increasing atmospheric water vapor

        ice cover in the polar areas has decreased significantly
            net loss of glacial ice since 1980

        recent sea level rise:
            remote sensing satalites can track changing sea level

            there was a rise in global sea leveel of 4.5 cm from 1993 to 2008
                thermal expansion of water from heat

                melting ice


    greenhouse gases:
        essential warmers of the planet

        burning of fossil fuels adds greenhouse gases to the atmosphere
        
        temperatures have increased over the last 50 years
            the debate is if this is because of co2 or not

    radiative forcing:
        describes amount by which some perturbation causes earth's energy
        balance to deviate from zero

        positive indicates warming, negative indicates cooling



    climate models:
        used to predict extent of global warming

        general circulation models:
            complex computer climate models

            contain several sub model programs for:
                atmosphere
                ocean
                land surface
                cryosphere
                bioshpere

            divides the earth surface into a grid of boxes
                each of these bnoxes consists of multiple layers

                each layer is a different level of the atmosphere

                each of these boxes have different parameters
                    these layers interact with adjacent boxes, to the side or
                    above and below
