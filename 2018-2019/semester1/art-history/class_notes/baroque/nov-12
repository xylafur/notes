- Some important things about this period
    - we call this period the baroque, the whole period of the 16th-17th century
      has to be viewed against the backdrop of manarism
        - one of the main themes in this period is the general turn of artists
          towards extreme naturalism
        - things do get a bit visually complicated in the middle of the 17th
          century
            - there is an aspect of an early barouqe (what we have been talking
              about so far)
            - turning away from all of the manarist stuff

        @ 24-16: Fernasay ceiling:
            - not visually complex
            - we see the hyper realism where the light that comes into the room
              is considered
            - intense illusinistic play
                - part of the naturalistic impulse

        * Caravaggio:
            - went to far in the realism
                - left behind much of the beauty of before
            - radical figure (according to early biographers)
                - very dark paintings with strong spotlight effects

            @ 24-18
                - this painting seems as if its extending into our own space

            - visual effects where something in the painting almost seems to be
              right in our face
                - a feeling that things in the painting are intruding into our
                  own space

        % naturalism of the baroque:
            - this consistent intrest in creating a dynamic realtionship between
              the work of art and the viewer
                - this is always there in the minds of artists, but during this
                  period artists are excentuating that aspect

* Bernini
    @ 24-8
        - Bernini designed everything about this place
            - he belives in a kind of scheme where the different artistic medium
              (sculpture, architecture, painting) need to all work together and
              be a sort of cohesive presentation
                - visual art as a sort of opera
                - the germans have a term: gazanskustvar
                    - total work of art or complete work of art
            - in 17th century art that wes a term that described bernini:
                - 'belcumposto': beautiful composite
                - the beautiful union of all of the medium

        - In the renisance there was a topic/ theme:
            - writers would debate about which is the superior medium
                - sculpture or painting

        - the sculture is of the telling of the virgin (can't remember what its
          called)
            - but all of the details are extreme
                - hair against the skin
                - rouch texture of the rock
                - complexity of the robe
                - obsessed with the differentation of the textures
            - it also appears that the virgin is floating
            - Bernini may be trying to rival painting
                - showing that sculpture can be extremley naturalistic

        - the work of art as theatre
            - we see that bernini created his own audience through sculpture
                - the people off to the sides
                - some of these people are important royals

        - this is a burial chapel
            - the inlayed marble floor in front has the skeletons
                - this skeleton is looking up and praying

        - there is definitely a level of realistic intensityo

    @24-4:
        - he was an architect as well as a sculpture
        - he thinks of his architecture in anthropomorphic ways
   

* Giovanni Battista Gaulli:
    @24-23:
        - If we are looking at the dome area:
            - The choir screen which seperates the choir and the altar
                - many churches were built with this in the midevil ages
                - they wanted people to be able to participate more directly in
                  the mass so it became more and more common to eliminate the
                  choir screen.

                - in this chruch we can see that there is no choir screen:
                    - you can see all the way to the altar when you walk in

            - the valuting of the ceiling was not decorated for a long time
                - In the 17th century Giovanni Battista Gaulli

        - The ceiling is refering to some passage form revelations
            - painted with fresco
            - all will bow before jesus
            - the expulsion of the vices from heaven
                - we see the people at the bottom all falling out
                - everyone else is all gathered around and adoring heaven

            - this is a mixture of actual painting and sculptures surrounding
              the painting
                - the painted parts are done such that it looks like they cast a
                  shadow onto the ceiling

$ The term baroque:
    - a book that was published in the 18th century contains the first usage of
      the term baroque
        - they invented to refer back to the 17th century

    - it was used earlier as a jewlers term
        - refered to misshapen pearls, not perfectly spherical

    - in the late 18th century that term begins to refer to an artistic style in
      painting and other mediums
        - the meaning is "irrecular, bizzare, unequal", proportions are
          presented in whatever way the artist wants to depict them

        - it was used as a sort of insult rtowards a style of art that they were
          criticising and trying to move past
            - made up by a bunch of neoclassical painters
            - later on in the 19th century it became more neutral tho


Assignment:
    we need to compare renisance vs baroque

    as we go from ren to barouqe we see the dramatic light dark contrast.
    Strong light that shines on the figures.

    dulches figures are extremley idealized.
        in a way its an artist who comes out of the classical barqoue period

    * the antoino:
        
    * other:
        - saint john the baptist on the left
        - same iconography as before
