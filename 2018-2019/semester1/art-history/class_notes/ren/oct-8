exam 1 grades should be posted tomorrow

The writers of this generation realized that something special was happening at
the time and among artists.
    it wasn't that their art was more naturalistic (we had perspective, this
    weird super naturalistim)

    it is that these paintings are more beautiful and more stylish

Oil paintings are the goto at this time in Italy

Leonardo:
    Trained as a painter in flourence.  After he leaves his teacher Borokio's
    workshop, most of his career is in Milan (which is in northern italy) and
    ruled by the Dukes of Milan

    22-2:
        altar piece, refered to as the viring in the rocks.

        Done for a church in Milan, specifically for a small chappel within the
        church.

        The medium is oil on wood, but transfered to canvas

        The play of dark and light in this painting:
            very unusal context, looks likle a cave or something

            Leonardo may be taking this from a tradition in Byzantine Icons in
            which the birth of christ took place in a cave

        terms regarding this painting (and leonardo's paintings in general):
            sfumato = smoky, vague, blurred

            chlaroscuro = bright and dark
    

        other siugnificant differences between this painting and those from the
        period right beforethis one:
            previous, pre renisaunce:
                people, when grouped together, in paintings from the previous
                period were often grouped together in a line, sohulder to
                shoulder.  ALl just tacked up at the front of the scene
                generally

            figures in this painting:
                in this painting, we see that the structure of people is much more
                like a pyramid.  They aren't all just lined up together

                the figures themselves seem to be 3 dimensional, rather than
                just their setting


    Leonardo left many notes:
        in these he conveyed that he wanted his paintings to appear sfumato,
        dark and mysterious

        he says in nature there are no pure colors, and no absolute contours

    22-4: the last supper
        mid 1490's, 1495-1498
        done for a church in Milan

        in this painting we have christ in the middle, surrounded on either
        side by the appostles

        medium:
            oil and tempra on plaster

            not really a fresco, more of a "fresco Seco" (dry tresco), which is
            terpra painted on plaster, though the plaster is dry.

            oil is also used, which is very weird
