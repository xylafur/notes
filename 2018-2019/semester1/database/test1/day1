Each Entity needs at least 1 or more attribute that uniquely identifies it

Relationship Set:
    connects two or more entity sets

    The vale of a relationship set is a set of currently related entity sets
    (keys)

    There are many to many relations, as well as many to one relations.  For
    instance if a drinker has a favorite beer, then that would be a many to
    one.  Since a group of many drinkers could all have the same beer, a single
    beer.
