Homework1:
    We have to know the domain we are creating the database for

    Relation from shipping manifest:
        we need to capture what we see and put it in the database

        she gives a hint where all of the attributes are listed


            this is 1nf
                because the key is shipment id and shipment number
                what??

            this is not 2nf:
                has partial dependencies

                to make it 2nf, we descompose it into different relatons

                shipment id only contains shipment id, arrival datae, etc

                Item number only relates to the type description, weight and
                quantity

                We then have 3 relations, shipment, item and the quantity that
                depends on both shipment and item

            is this 3nf?
                shipment is not 3NF:
                    because captain name depends on captain ID

                    to make it 3nf we decompose

                    shipment id goes to captain id, but not captain name.
                    Captain ID goes to captain name

                We now have 3 relations and they are all in 3NF



        Captain ID and Captain Name are related, the ID determines name

        
        Shipment iD determines everything, captain id relates to the captain
        Name, item number relates to the type, description, weight quantity

            the list of items is uniquely identified by the item number, so the
            specifics of the items is related to the item numbers





    Normalizing:

Godd database design depends only on the key, is in 3NF and BCNF

1NF:
    means you have a key??

2NF:
    you don't have partial dependency, your key does not have more than one
    attribute

3NF:
    transitive dependencies
    one of our attributes is a key, we also contain a attribute of that key
    (relation).  We can fix this by having out main key relate to that key, and
    not its attribute
