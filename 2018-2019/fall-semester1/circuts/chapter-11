11.1 - Introduction:
    Capacitor voltage cannot change instantly - it can not jump from one value
    to another abruptly.  It climbs gradually and smothly: capacitor voltage
    must be continuous at all times

    The current is not continous.  It jumps from 0 to E/R amps instantly
        once the capacitor is fully charged the current drops to 0 through the
        capacitor and the entire line involving that capacitor

        this is because the current is only due to the moving electons as the
        capacitor is changing

    Steady State:
        when the current and voltage stop changing the circut is said to be in
        steady state.  V = E and I = 0

        Since the capacitor has voltage across but no current it looks like a
        short circut
    
    Discharing:
        If the capacitor is charged to E volts, it will momentarily act as a
        voltage source of E volts when it begins discharging.  THe current
        jumps to -E/R amps.  The volrage and current decay to 0 over time


    Time Transient Analysis:
        time begins at 0 when the switch is flipped to charge or discharge -
        depending on what we are looking at. After the switch, voltage and
        current become functions of time.

        we Ic(0) is not defined because of the discontinuous jump
            to get around this, we define 2 values for 0s.  t = 0-s as t = 0s
            just prior to switching and t=0+s as t=0s just after switching
            
            therefore ic(0-) = 0A and ic(0+0) = (+/-)E/R


        exponential functions:
            waveforms are exponential and vary according to e^-x or (1 - e^-x)
