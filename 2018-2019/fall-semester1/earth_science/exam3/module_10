Earth's Changing Landscaps Systems

Tectonics, Earthquakes and Volcanism

Earth's Surface relif features:
    relief regers to the vertical elevation difference

    crustal order's of reliefs:
        first order:
            broadest category that includes continental platforms and ocean
            basics

        second order:
            includes mountains masses, plains and lowlands

        third order:
            most detailed and includes individual mountains, cliffs, vallets...

    topography:
        above sea level

    Earth's hypsometry:
        shows the highest and  lowest points on the earth along with mean sea
        level

    Earth's topographic regions:
        plains:
            local relief less than 100 meters
                means that difference between max and min is no more than 100m

        high table lands:
            elevations over 1250 meters

    Crustal formation processes:
        cratons:
            nuclei of contents: ancient crystalline
                the core of the continent

            date back to precambrian
            regions of thickist lithosphere

            represent ancient crustal rocks that have been significantly
            deformed

        continental shield:
            regions where the craton is exposed at the surface

            allows us to look at ancient rocks

    Oldest minerals on earth:
        detrital zircons found in western australia
            up to 4.4 billion years old

        relics of earth's earlierst continental crust

    oldest rocks on earth:
        acasta gneiss in NW canada

        sugests that the continental crust did not become permanent until about
        4 billion years ago

Earliest Proto continents:
    over 4 billion years ago:
        smaller than continents today

        preserved today within metamorphic gneiss

        continued plume activity, mantle convection and partial melting of the
        underlying mantle resulted in growth of proto continents

        over the next billion years, smaller proto continents amalgamated into
        larger land masses through collisions driven by early plate tectonics

            some people thing plate tectonics started 4.2 byo, other think
            around 1.4 byo.. very wide range

growth of continents:
    eventually larger continents grew from proto continents

    they growed from:
        - addition of igneous material
            occurs along convergent plate boundaries

            melting rock that has gone down towards the mantle will bubble up in
            magma packets

        - accrestion of crustal fragments:
            convergent playe boundaries are sites of accretion
            
            island chains can hit into a continent and meld with it
                this causes another subduction / trench to form

        - erosion of uplifted areas followed by sediment depision
        - collision and assembly with other continents

Super continent cycle:
    2 major super continents existed o er the last 1 billion years
        rodinia:
            assembled 1 byo

        pangea:
            assembled 230 myo

    both may be part of the 'super continent cycle'
        begins with a super continent
            a large layer on insolation sitting on top of the mantle

            keeps the mantle hot, keeps it from cooling
            
            the mantle is being heated from below as well
                it heats up over time and generates plume activity

        continent splits appart
            a new ocean is created

        the coninents disperse and spread apart more

        continents converge towards another site
        
        they collide eventually

        a new super continent is formed
            the cycle starts over again

Crustal Deformation Process:
    Rocks subjected to powerful tectonic forces, burial and gravity to the point
    where deformation occurs:

    2 types:
        folding

        faulting:
            break and slip 

    Force and Stress:
        force:
            puts objects in motion

        stress:
            force applied to a particular area

        differential stress:
            unequal stress

            3 tyles:
                compressional:
                    squeezed and shorten

                    convergent boundaries


                tensional:
                    stretch and pull it apart

                    divergent boundaries

                shearing:
                    push different parts of body in opposite directions

                    transform boundaries


    2 types of deformation:
        brittle:
            increasing stress causes rock to deform by fracturing

            typical in the upper crust where lower temps and lower pressures
            exitst

        ductile:
            increasing stress causes the rock to undergo smooth and continuous
            deformation

            no fracturing

            typical in the deep crust


            folds:
                twists and bends in roks

                ductile deformation of rocks in response to externel forces
                    anticlines:
                        layered rocks that were folded into arches

                    synclines:
                        layered rocks folded into troughs

                plunging folds:
                    multiple differential stresses can happen at the same time


                domes:
                    anticlinal structure

                    convex layers below the surface that dip away in all
                    directions from the dome

                    oldest rocks in the center

                basin:
                    oposite of a dome

                    layers are bowl shapped depressions that dip

            Faults:
                plane of dislocation whre rocks on one side have moved relative
                to rocks on the other side

                can happen from any of the stresses, but the type depends on the
                type of stress

                Normal fault:
                    if we view the fault as a plane
                    handing wall:
                        side of the rock on type of the fault plane

                    foot wall:
                        side of the rock on the bottom of tha fault plane

                    hanging wall side is below the foot wall side
                       
                    

                    if we have multiple faults back to back we have uplfaulted
                    and downfaulted blocks
                        the upfaulted are valled horsts

                        the downfaulted are called grabens


                In the wilson cycle:
                    firting can eventually open up into a linear sea

                Thrust / Reverse fault:
                    the handing wall moves upward relative to the foot wall

                   
                    Reverse vs thrust faults:
                        both because of brittle horizonal squeezing;

                        reverse faults:
                            fault angles > 45
                            generally small

                        thrust falls:
                            fault angles < 45

                            very large

                Stripe Slip Faults:
                    one block slips horizontally past the other

                    results from shear stress

                    happens along transform boundaries

Tectonics, Earthquakes, Volcanoes
    orogenesis:
        mountain building event


        3 types:
            ocean-ocean convergent:
                2 oceanic plates where one subductes over the other, forming a
                deep trench

                as the subducting plate descents, some of the sediments from the
                sea floor get scraped off and build up the elading edge

                the slab releases water which lowers the melting temp, causing
                melting of the mantle

                the mantle rises to the surface and creates a volcanic island
                arc

                these arcs are known as volcanic island arcs

            ocean-continent convergence:
                oceanic plate subducts under continental plate

                trench forms

                subducting ocean plate causes the mantle to melt and the magma
                rises towards the surface

                the volcanos are part of a continous mountain belt
                    this is because of a lot of horizontal compression

                these are known as volcanic ranges



            continent-continent:
                start out with ocean continent convergence boundary

                this brings continents on opposite plates together

                the continent on the subductinf plate finally reaches the trench
                    the continent being lessdense will not subduct

                this produces significant mountain ranges

        Earthquakes:
            generated when slippage occurs along a fault plane

            energy is released in seismic waves
                hypocenter;
                    area of fault spillage on the fault plane

                epicentere:
                    area on the surfae directly above the hypocenter

            Elastic Rebound Theory:
                fault plane initially at rest

                as force is applied:
                    the fault is locked and resist movement

                    elastic energy builds up around the fault

                eventually the fault slips and energy is removed as seismic
                waves

                the fault then moves back to its original shape but in a new
                location

            waves:
                p waves
                s waves
                surface waves:
                    slowest but does the most damage because of its high
                    amplitude




            Foreshocks and aftershocks:
                foreshocks:
                    beore the earthquake, minor earth quake as the stress builds
                    up
                    
                aftershocks
                    after the earth quake as the fault adjusts after the
                    slippage

            Mesuring:
                midified Mercalli:
                    ranges from 1 - 12
                    mainly based on amount of damage


                richter scale:
                    numeric scale, 1-10

                    based on ampluitued of waves

                moment magnitude:
                    measures the energy released


10_c:
    earthquakes continues

    occur mostly along active plate boundaries

    San Andresas Fault:
        major stripe-slip fault systems

        sluppage differs along different segments:
            some segments continuously slip

            causes very small earthquakes along those segments

            some slip at regular intervals

            other are tightly locked:
                strain builds up over 50-200 years and eventuall splis


    Volvanism:
        locations:
            divergent plate boundaries
            convergent plate boundaries
            intraplate volcanism associated with mantle plumes and hotspots

        volcanic features:
            crater:
                curcular depression found at the summit

            conduit:
                connects the crater to the underlying magma chamber

            type of eruptions:
                effusive (mild)
                    mafic magma

                    erupts enormous volumes of basalcitic lava

                    sites:
                        mid ovcean ridges

                        shield volcanoes associated with mantle plumes
                            type of landform associated with effusive eruptions
                            in oceanic type envionrments

                            constructed from successive flows of basalctic lava:
                                low silica content
                                low viscosity

                            have broad gentle slopes


                        plateau basalts on continents
                            associated with mantle plumes below both continents
                            and oceans

                            low viscosity lava erupts througgh fissures

                            fluid nature of the lava allows alot of distance to
                            be covered by the lava

                    tpyes?:
                        seafloor due to decompressoin melting beneith mid ocean
                        ridges

                        effusive eruptions within plates:
                            intra plate colcanism

                            mantle plumes

                            localized volcanic regions are called hot spots
                                produces basaltic magma


                explosive
                    typically associated with convergent

                    magma is much more viscous and gas rich

                    development of pyroclastic flow:
                        eruption begins to collaps over time and then flow back
                        down the side of the volcano

                    compostive volcanoes:
                        erupt both lavas and pyroclactic material

                        steeper slopes and generally smaller than sheild
                        volcanoes:
                            common along convergent plate boundaries

                        assicoated with alarge undergound magma chamber

                    caldera:
                        after violent eruption, overlying rock collapses into
                        the empty magma chamber that was left beind by the
                        eruption

                        Forms a large depression on the surface
                            many times the size of the original crater

                    Cinder cones:
                        contructed mainly of pyroclastic material

                        small in size, steep slopes, occur in groups


                factors:
                    temperature of the magma

                    magma chemistry and viscosity
                        low silica magma is more fluid
                    
                    dissolved gasses
                        higher gas content leads to more explosive eruptions

        Volcanoes and the Climate:
            explosive eruptions emit huge quantities of gases and ash

            a portion of the incoming solar radiation is reflected
                cases climate cooling over the next few months and years
