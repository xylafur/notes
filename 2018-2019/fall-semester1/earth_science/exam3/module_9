Dynamic Planet

a_1:
    We will begin looking at the solid earth, beginning with the interior

    Earth has an internal heat engine - some of the processes contributing to
    this heat engine are:
        - head released by coliding particles during formation of earth
        - heat released during gravitational contraction of the early earth
        - heat emitted by radioactive decay of unstable isotopes within earth
        - early impact with protomoon
        - as iron crystalized to form solid iron core

    Now we go back to the formation of thea earth - after collisions of
    planetesimals and such

    Because earth and other early planets were very hot:
        the hot softened interiors allowed migration of materials based on
        density.

        The denser material such as iron settled to the core while lighter
        material settled to the surface
            this is reponsible for the internal layering of the planet

    Soon after impact with proto moon:
        Earth was covered by a magma ocean that was hundreds if not thousands
        of km deep

        over time the ocean cooled and formed the mantle capped with the crust
        on the top

        Young earth as we said was very hot from collisions and decay of
        radioactive isotopes

        over time the earth gradually cooled to its present state - four and a
        half billion years after first formation
            the mantle and crust contain long lived radioactive isotopes that
            continue to decay and keep our planet from becoming an iceball
                this includes uranium, thorium, potassium which all have
                halflives of millions to billions of years

    Earth's internal layers:
        going bottom to top
        Inner core:
            Iron sank to the very bottom, forming the inner core

        Outer core

        Lower mantle 

        upper mantle

        asthenosphere

        lithosphere
        
        crust


    Study of solid earth:
        difficult to study the earth's interior
            we can drill down a few kilometers into earth's crust

            geophysical surveys can determine what is underneath though

        methods of exploring subsurface:
            uplifting
                techtonic properties can bring deeper rocks up to the
                surface

            rocks above 5km

            drilling

            magma can bring up pieces of deeper rocks

            geophysical surveys:
                seismic-reflection data

                electrical surveys
                    good way to study ground water

                magnetic data
                    airial surveys

                gravity data



        investigating deep processes:
            we can study rocks with deep origins

            we can use computer models based on seismic refraction data

            we can replicte deep conditions in the lab
                take rocks and subject them to high pressure and temps

            Seismic Waves:
                tectonic forces can cause crust and lithosphere to break along
                faults

                slippage releases energy as seismic waves
                    create vibrations known as earthquakes

                site of initial fault slippage is caled the hypocenter (focus)
                point on the surface above the focus is called the epicenter

                there are wave fronts that propigate from the hypocenter
                seismograph:
                    instruments that measue vibrations in the ground
                    
                    several instruments:
                        one for up and down
                        one east west
                        one north south



                3 groups
                    (P)rimary waves
                        travel the fastest, get to the seismograph first

                        average velocity of 5km/s
                        travel though all mediums

                        propogates like a slinky - a series of compressions and
                        expansions

                    (S)econdary waves
                        second to be recorded by the seismograph

                        travel half the speed of P waves

                        push material at right angles.

                        Wave move like a wave propogating though a rope.
                            the wave peak is perpindicular to the propogation
                            of the wave

                        canot travel though liquid

                        
                    surface waves
                        slowest and arrive last

                        slightly slower than s wave.  SImilar to waves in the
                        ocean

                        a few types:
                            travels like rolling ocean waves

                            side to side motion
                                damaging to buildings

                We can create rays that intersect the waves perpindicular from
                every direction
                    to follow the wave through the earth we follow a single ray

                    waves get both reflected and refracted!
                        we lose some energy because the wave is split

                    when the wave encounters a material of different type the
                    wave gets both reflected and refracted.
                        its basically snells law from physics

                    when wave gets faster the ray bends towards the
                    intersection

                    when the wave slows down it builds more towards the normal
                    of the intersection


            Seismic study show that the continental crust is quite a bit
            thicker than oceanic crust
                Crust:
                    continental
                        less dense (more buoyant)

                    oceanic

                Upper mantle:
                    Lithosphere:
                        cool rigid layer
                        
                        averages about 100km thick, but can be up to 250 km
                        thick

                        broken into a series of plates

                    asthenosphere:
                        just below the lithosphere

                        contains softed peridotite which is known as the low
                        velocity zone - this is where seismic waves will slow
                        down

                        as we get lower this peridotite becomes solid again

                    Upper Transition Zone: 400 km depth
                        olivine changes to a spiral crystal structure
                            stable under lower pressures, becomes much more
                            dense

                            this causes s and p waves to increase in velocity

                    Lower transition Zone: 670 km
                        spinel crystal tructure comes even more tightly packed,
                        which causes another increase in the velocity of s and
                        p waves

            P waves can change to S waves - this is how we get S waves through
            the inner core even though they can't pass though liquid, and thus
            the liquid outer core


a_2:
    Talking about earth's magnetic field now

    As earth rotates the liquid iron rorates:
        this circulation generates electric field

        this causes a magnetic field to form

        Earth's liquid core behaves like the coil of an electro magnet
            leave at the south pole and enter at the north pole

            the rotational axis does not align with the magnetic pole


    The geothermal gradient:
        rate at which temp increases as you descent into the earth

        this becomes significantly less once we go into the mantle / core

        the geothermal gradient is significant in the crust
            the mantle is kinda liquid up at the top by the asthenosphere but
            then gets solid again until we get to the outer core

            The partial melting is though to occur at the D layer

    Earth's internal heat engine:
        heat escapes from the interior from very slow radioactive decay

        the movement of earth's internal source towards the surface is called
        heat flow:
            earth's modern heat flow varys from place to place

            high heat flow along mid ocean ridges and other volcanic regions
            lower heat flow in interoir of stable continents

        internal heat engine:
            heat flow in crust:
                conduction:
                    not efficient way to carry heat

            thorugh mantle:
                only a modest increase in temp with depth

                the manth must have an effective method for transmitting heat
                from the core upward to the base of the crust
                    convction would be an effective process

    Therories of mantle convectin:
        2 layer convection model:
            seperate convection cells between upper and lower mantle
                each section has its own circulation

            boundary is at 670 km transition zone

        whole mantle convection:
            upper and lower mantle part of one large convection system

            hot rising mantle plumes originat at the core mantle boundary rising
            up to the lithosphere
                these plumes hit the crust and form hot spots which are things
                like volcanoes or whatever

    Seismic Tomogrraphy:
        3d model of earth's interior based on eismic imaging

        requires seismic records from many different earthquakes

        identifies regions where p and s waves tend to be faster or slower than
        average

        these variations in speed can be attributed to different temps or
        material properties
            high temp: slower velocity
            low temp: higher velocity


b_1:
    Abraham Ortelius and Francis Bacon:
        Continents like jigsaw

    Eduard Suess:
        maybe one big land awhile ago

    Alfred Wegner 1915:
        pangea

    Wengner set forth the idea of continental drift
        he discovered mountain belts from NA and Europe were alligned

    when we assemble SA and Africa:
        we see the same rocks on both

    Paleoclimatic Evidence of continental drift:
        glacial deposits in SA, Africa, India and Australia

        evidince of past glaciation:
            small rocks are preserved in the glaciers
            when they melt we see the deposits wherever they melted

            when glacers move across bedrock the sediment form grooves and
            indicate the direction of ice movement

            they have been able to plot these grooces to determine how the
            continents fit together
                this shows how the ive flows make sense

                the ice originated in the south pole and then moved north
                through the continents with these grooves

        Fossils:
            see fossils for the same plants / animals on continents seperated by
            oceans

    Continental drift hypothesis:
        major flaw was no one had a mechanism

        1960s - WW2 ech provided a mechanism:
            mantle convection and seafloor spreading

        modern evidence:
            high heat flow on mid ocean ridges
            polar wander curves
            magnetic stripes on the seaflor


        mid ocean ridges:
            If we drained the oceans we would see high mountain ranges

            discovered using sonar

            sites of high heat flow from underwater volcanoes

            deep sea trenches and volcanoes have been discovered recently

        some of these form linear trends which can be explained with plate
        tectonics

    Earcth's magnetic field:
        discovered by the chinese in 13th century

        compass:
            has 2 components:
                inclination: tilt of magnetisation
                    angle a compass needle makes with the earth's surface and is
                    a function of latitude

                declination: horizontal swing
                    compas direction presently points towards the magnetic north
                    pole

        Measuring paleomagnetism in rocks:
            lava has magnetic particles

            when it solidifies the magnetic materials allign with the magnetic
            field

            they then act like compass needles
                so we can see the previous magnetic fields and such

            the magnetic field flips every now and then

        During ww2 it was discovered:
            tech to help subs navigte

            there are matching magnetic stripes away from the ridges leading to
            weird anomolies
                ships that sale across thse were able to map them

            the features can be explained by the fact that new ocean crust forms
            along the ridges
                spreading along the ridge pushs rocks aside
                    would occur in conjunction with occasional flips in earth's
                    magnetic field

                this explains the mirror image that is seen

        Magnetic Reversal Time Scale:
            in 1831 the magnetic pold was in candada

            the magnetic field has weakened by ~ 10% in the last century

            what would the effects on life be?
                doesn't seem to be any evidence that it would cause problems but
                who knows

    Determining ages of oceanic crust:
        dated using mostly fossils and corelating magnetic strips with the time
        scale

        seafloor spreading happens at about 1-18 centimeters per year

        youngest oceanic crust ocur along the mid ocean ridge

        oldest oceanic cruss dates to the late jurassic
            tends to be along the continents


b_2:
    Continuing on with plate tectonics

    Earthquakes:
        follow tends that occur along boundries between plates

        shallow earthquakes recorded over time tent to match the trenc of mid
        ocean ridges

    Volcanoes:
        the same trends as earthquakes

        along mid ocean ridges, continents parallel to ocean trenches

    Plates:
        divisions of the lithospehere, includes crust and upper layer of solid
        mantle
            slide across the athenosphere, the sphere sphere of partial melting

        3 types of bondraies
            1 - divergent (mid ocean reidges)
                plates pull appart

            2 - convergent:
                plates come together
                
                1 plate is subducted and destroyed in the process
                    usually the oceanic plate

                associated with trenches and volcanic arcs



            3 - transform
                plates slide past eachother

                lithosphere is niehter created or destroyed:
                    most join segments of a mid ocean reidge along breaks called
                    fracture zones

                    a few cut through continental crust

                line between two fracture zones moving in opposite directions

            Intraplate volcanism
                linear chains of volcanoes also occur in ocean basins far
                removes from plate boundaries

                the most widely accepted theory is that these are created by
                uprising hot plumes which surcace as hot spots

                in case of oceanic lithosphere:
                    the splume creates a hot spot which is the cause of
                    volcanoes on the sea floor

                as plates move over hot spots a volcano is formed
                    as the plate moves they will move off of the hot spot and
                    the volcano will disappear

                    the plate eventully subsides and cools


            New oceanic lithosphere that is created by divergent plates is
            eventually pushed back into the earth by a convergent plate.
                this is known as the plate tectonic cycle

                driven by mantle convection and powered by earth's internal heat

                wilson cycle:
                    opening and closing of an ocean

                    Crustal Doming
                        starts with the crust under which is an impenging mantle
                        plume.
                        
                        this plume creates an upwarping and some volcanic
                        activity on the surface

                    Rifting:
                        eventually the continental lithosphere splits into 2
                        segments moving in opposite directions.

                        A continental rift opens in between:
                            valley with alot of volcanoes

                    Linear Sea:
                        2 sections of the continental lithosphere split apart so
                        the nearby ocean can floor in and create a 'linear sea'

                    Mature ocean:
                        linear sea opens and new oceanic crust is created in the
                        seperated region

                    Closing of an ocean:
                        we need converging plates

                        as the ocean plate goes under one of the continental the
                        two continents on either side go down under


                        declining stage:
                            the continents start moving towards eachother

                        Remnant Stage
                            the two continents are getting close to eachother
                            and crust starts to build up significantly along one

                        Suture zone:
                            when the continents hit eachother

    The geologic Cycle:
        two systems operating at the earth' atmosphere interface

            endogenic:

                    - igneous activity
                    - sedimentation

                mainly powered by solar:
                    weathering
                    erosion
                    mass wasting

                mostly hydrologic cycle

        fueled by earth's heat and solar energy

        3 cycles Make it up:
            1 - hydrologic cycle

            2 - rock cycle
                produces 3 basic rock types found in crust

                powered by earth's internal heat energy

            3 - tectonic cycle


    Overall composition of earth
        Minerals:
            definition
                naturally occuring and therefore generally found in nature

                solid within temp range for earth's surface

                orderly crystalline structure, atoms in orderly repetative
                manner
                    - different minerals have different crystal forms
                    - though we can't see this directly we can see the overal
                      shape
                    - of the mineral which exposes the crystaline structure

                well definied chemical composition

                generally inorganic, even though some contain carbon

        major classes:
            silicates:
                priniciple atom is silicon bonded to oxygen

                all made up of silicon ions surrounded by oxygen ions
                    called the silicon oxygen tetrohedrian

                the basic building block for all silicon minerals is based on
                thsee tetrahedron

                these minearls are broken in the other groups based on how the
                terahedron's interact with eachother

                can also link together with other tetrahedra:
                    - they link together in chains, either single or double
                    - they can also link together in sheets
                    - also into complex 3d structures

                * most common minerals in earth's crust
                    only 8% of earth's minearls non silicates

            carbonites:
                carbon is an important component

                one thing in common:
                    co3 complex

                    this has a net chage of -2
                        it can bond to positively charged cations

            oxides
                oxygen atom (net charge -2) is bonded to cations

            halides:
                flourine, cholorine and broming

                formed form ionic bonds

            sulfides and sulfates:
                sulfatres:
                    sulfer is present as the sulfate ion
                        (net charge -2)
                        can bond with cations

                sulfides:
                    sulfer occurs seperately and can also bond with cations
                    

            native minerals:
                just a single atom makes up the mineral

                graphite, diamond, copper, gold, sulfur....

    Rock Cycle :
        solid earth materials are composed of:
            minerals:
                held together chemical elements held together by bonds

            rocks:
                composed of minerals

                3 basic catagories:
                    igneous
                        crystalized from magma

                    sedimentary

                    metamorphic:
                        when the original parent rock undergoes changes from
                        temp and pressure and such

        cyclge:
            - starts at magma deep in the earth

            - rising magma rises cools
                crystalizes and forms igenous rocks

            - these igneous rocks on the surface are broken down by weathering and
              such
                
                this results in sediment

                something picks up and moves this sediment (glaceres, wind, ..)

            - sedimentary roks:
                this sediment becomes buried and cements together and becomes
                compected

            - these sedimentary rocks become deeply buried
                this results in metamorphisms and metamorphic rocks

            - metamorphic rocks eventuall melt into magma


            * We do not always have to follow the cycle:
                there are certain jumps that can happen

                sediment or igneous rock can melt directly for example


    Origin of magma
        enerated thorugh the melting of solid rock

        temp increases with depth in the upper crust due to the geothermal
        gradient

        eventually rocks in the lower crust and upper mantle
            any additional heat results in them melting

        Roll of volatiles:
            volatiles  cause rocks to melt at lower temps

            primarily water

            important factor where oceanic lithosphere desccends into the mantle

        as the subductiong oceanic lithosphere it melts due to the saturated
        rock

        role of pressure:
            an increase in pressure with depths increases a rocks melting temp
                higher temp required for deeper rocks

            mantle material that is brought up sees a decrease
                this can cause decompression melting as the rock surfaces

            a mantle plume will rise
                it keeps the temp of the rock above it the same as it was before

                the rock will rise as well and eventually melt once the pressure
                is low enough

                this is called ***DECOMPRESSION MELTING***

        so really the 2 ways to make magma are with volatiles and decompression
        melting

        
        Bowen's reaction series:
            different silicate minerals melt or crystalize at different temps

            the types of minerals comprising an igneous rock depend on its
            composition as well as its temp
                ultframafic:
                    high temp rocks

                mafic:
                
                intermediate:
                    lower temps rocks, mainly formed by minerals found down the
                    bowen's reactoin series

                felsic

d_1:
    the types of minerals that crystalize from the magma depends on the temp and
    composition

    magma forms a hot liquid produces when pre-existing rock melts

    when a rock is heated, and the lower temp minerals melt while higher temp
    remain solid, this is called partial melting

        if we start out with peridatite and raise the temp, eventually lower
        temp minerals will melt and hte higher temp minerals will remain,
        leaving beside only the higher temp crysals
   
    partial melting:
        takes on the composition of the melted minerals

        solid minerals remaining behind define the composition of the residial
        rocks


        the magma that is formed from this partial melting:
            it has mafic or basaltic composition (lower melting temp rocks)

            this rises o the uper mantle and onds along the bottom of the crust

            this will rise up through the crust and melt from rocks as it goes

        evolution of basalctic magma as it rises though the crust

    igneous rocks:
        rocks depe in the crust and upper mantle will eventually melt
            we can melt periditite by adding volatiles

            can also melt from mantle plumes (decompresion melting)

        formation:
            molten magma rises from deep in the crust or upper mantle, cooling
            as it rises

            during the cooling and crystalization the composition of th magma
            will change

            the sizes of minerals that form are contolled by the rate of magma
            cooling

            thecomposition and mineral size of an igneous rock tell us about the
            history of the magma from which the rock crystallized

        slow cooling at depth:
            some magmas remain below the surface

            these reside in magma chambers for a long time

            insulated by the surrounding crust and cool very slowly
                large crystals have along time to form

            the resulting ignesous rocks is coarsely crysaling

            we can see the minerals with our eyes in rocks that are formed this
            way

            sometimes magma will start to crystalize below the surface but then
            erupts into the surface and cools quicly
                large minerals are the ones that cooled slowly while the
                remaining forms a substance where the large minerals remain

        fast cooling on surface:
            some magmas make it to the surface of the earth:
                form lava flows if gas poor and fluid

                if viscous and rich in dissolved gases, magma erupts explosively
                to vorm volcanic ash and glass

            lavas on the surface cool quickly such that the crystals have little
            time to grow
            
            finely crystalline or glass and termed extrusive or volcanic

            extrusive igneous rocks form quickly:
                the minerals in the rock are very small and may not even exist

        classification:
            we consider the composition and the mineral sizes:
                composition:
                    overal silicon content

                    ultramafic < 45%
                    mafic 45 - 52 %
                    intermidiate 52 - 65%
                    felsic > 65%

                corselty or finely crystalized


            ultramafic igneous rocks:
                peridotite comprises the upper mantle

                very dark in color

                high ammounts of iron and magnesium

            * partial melting of mantle peridotite forms mafic (basaltic mantle)

            mafic:
                dark colored

                abuntant calcium rich feldspar

                high density ebcause they contain iron

            evetually the crystaliation of the original mafic magma will form
            intermediate and felsic compositions
            
            intermedite igneous rocks:
                compositionally between flesic and mafic

                finely crystal:
                    andesite

                coarsely crystalline:
                    diorite

            as magma rises though continental crust, it undergoes assimilation
            (melting) of continental crust.  This crust is rich in silicon
                modifies the magma composition so that it eventually becomes
                very rich in potasium, sodium, silicon...

                the crystalization of this magma results in felsic rocks igneous

            felsic igneous rocks:
                light colored

                abundant in minerals from bottom of bowen's reaction series
                    quarts, feldspar, na-rich plagioclase feldspar

                small amounts of plate like micas and rod like horneblende
                    finely crystlline:
                        rhyolite

                    coarsely:
                        grannite



        igneous intrusions:
            batholiths:
                plumes that completely crystalize will eventually be pushed to
                thesurface and form mountain looking things of igenous rocks
                called batholiths

            dikes:
                perpindicular intrustions that usuall go through sedimentary
                rock at the surface

            sills:
                tabular instrustions that run parallel to the sedimentary layers
                on the top of the crust


        Viscosity and volcanic eruptions:
            small fraction of magma reaches the surface and erupts

            low silica magmas have  low viscosity (more like fluid) and lose
            gasses easliy
                mild lava flows

            high silica magmas:
                very thick and sticks and retain their gasses

                when they emerge on the surface they flow very slowly

            pyroclastic eruptions:
                viscous, gas rich magmaof intermediate to high silica

                very exxplosive

                throws pieces of rock and shit everywiere:
                    these solic particles rain down
                    accumulate on the ground

                    the particles eventuall cement together to form pytoclastic
                    rocks

                naming of pyroclastics:
                    ash:
                        mainly individual minerals, rock fragments and volcanic
                        glass

                    lapilli:
                        individial fragments of minerals

                    bombs:
                        weird shapes due to solidifivation while airborn

                    blocks:
                        large chunks of rock broken form within and around the
                        volcanic conduit

    Weathering and sedimentary rocks:

        sediments include;
            rock fragments
                mechanical weathering

            clay minerals and or iron oxides:
                chemical weathering

            disolved ions

        weathering:
            reactants:
                rock
                wather
                acid

            products:
                rock fragments
                clay minerals
                dissolved ions

            
            chemical weathering:
                change in the chemical composition of the rock

                dissolution:
                    rocks like limestone disolve

                hydrosis:
                    certain silicate mineralts converted inot clay

                oxidation:
                    converts iron to hematite

                biological interactions

            Detridal sediments:
                formed from weathering of preexiting rock
            
                once the sediments form, the particules are transported
                somewhere else via many means

            Suseptibility:
                different minerals are more or less resistant to weathering

                minerals most resistant to weathering are likely to end up as
                sediment

                ones that arent suseptible are quickly destroyed and pretty rare
                to find in sediment

        Sedimentary ROcks:
            formed by weathering, about 8% of earth's crust

            provide information about ancient sediment transport and fossils

            3 goups:
                detridal:
                    made of particles of pre existing rocks

                chemical
                    precipitated from water, sometimes with the aid of marine
                    organisms

                organic:
                    mosly remains of plants and animals (coal)

            formation:
                begins with weathering.

                sediment is transported

                deposited when solid particles settle out or ions in solution
                are precipitated by inorganic or biological processes

                then it is buried and transformed into sedimentary rock over
                time




                

d_2:
    sedimentary envionrments:
        geographic setting where sediment accumulates

        determines the nature of the sediments that accumulate:
            seddiments may ultimarely be buried and cemented into a
            sedimentary rock

        comon locatinos:
            - base of mountains
            - glacial valleys
            - streams and rivers
            - sand dunes
            - along coast
                in beach brougt in from the continents

            - coastal dunes are locations behind the beach
            - reefs
            - lagoons

    types of input and output:
        - gravel -> conglomerate
        - sand -> sandstone
        - silty mud -> siltstone
        - clay mud -> shale

        sediments accumulate (burial)
        pore spaces between grains close (compaction)
        pore fluids crystalize mineral cements (lithinfication)

    classification:
        detrital:
            - rocks formed from particles of pre existing rocks
            - named based on the size of the particles
                - the name is based on the largest particle

            bretcha
                largest particles are angular

            congolmerate
                largest particles are rounded
           

        chemical and biochemical:
            mainly from dissolved ions due to weathering
                typically form in marine locations

            mainly classified on the basis of composition
                limestone:
                    carbonite rock composed of calcite

                    formed in a variety of enviornments
                        warm shallow seas, coral reefs and caves as travertite


                chalk:
                    carbonate comosed of microscopic shells of marine fossils

                dolostone:
                    carbonate rock comosed of dolomite

                chert:
                    very dense, composed of quartz

                    often formed within cavities of pre existing rock

                evaporites:
                    form from the evaporation of very salty water
                        sea water or brines

                    typically sea water floods a semi enclosed basin:
                        this water evaporates, the disolved ions are left behind

                        the water can no longer keep all of these in solutions

                        so they minerals begin to crystalize

                coal:
                    originates as a swamp
                        as the vegitatino in the once swamp becomes buried
                        it becomes pete over time
                        at greater burial and compaction lignite coal is formed
                        with even greater burial and compaction:
                            it becomes the coal we use for power generation
    Metamorphic Rocks:
        eventually rocks can be altered if subjected to high enough temperatures
        and forces
            - the parent rock can be any type of rock
            - though the original minerals are not stable at high temp and
              pressure and will become new minerals

        types:
            regional:
                high temps and pressures over large areas

                intens alteration of the original rock:
                    re crystalization and formation of new minerals
                    original layers are destroyed

                usually occurs convergent plate boundaries

            contact:
                along the margins of an adjacent magma chamber

                the composition of th eresulting rock depends on the composition
                of the original rock

            hydrothermal:
                results from reactons between warm fluid and rock

                water can go though the cracks of a fault
                    the water heats up
                    the warm mineral rich waters will rise back up and undergo
                    reactions with the oceanic crust

                    black smokers are formed by this, they spew hot mineral rich
                    sea water

            active faults:
                the movement of plates fractures, sheerses and pulvierises rocks


        Classification:
            divided into 2 broad categories

                folidated rocks:
                    preferential alignment of platy minerals in a common
                    directoin

                    occurs under differential stress and shearing

                    a rock may be subjected to very strong horizontal stress:
                        this forces the rocks to either be squeezed or pushed
                        into the same orientation

                non foliated:
                    no preferential allignment or minerals or other features

                    some types of metamorphism lack the conditions for forming
                    foliated textures:
                        contact machanism
                        hydrothermal metamorphism
                        metamorphism without platy minerals
