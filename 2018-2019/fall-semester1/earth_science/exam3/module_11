Earth's changing landscape systems

Earth-atmosphere interface:
    we have been lookig at the inputs of the systems and the action

    lithospere interacts with the hydrosphere:
        weathering:
            physical breakdown into sediment by physical or chemical mean

            facors affecting:
                compostition of bedrock

                character of bedrock
                    joints faults etc

                climate
                    chemical weathering happens faster in warmer areas

                    physical happens faster in cold areas

                vegetation
                    tree roots etc

            Suseptibility to weathering:
                quartz, hematite and clat are most resistant to weathering

                mafic silicates are most suseptible to weathering

        erosion:
            phyical removal by water wind ice whatever

            causes:
                streams:
                    carry most water from land to sea
                    shape surface of earth

                    3 zones:
                        zone of sediment production:
                            sediment builds up

                        zone of transporation:
                            sediment is carried

                        zone of deposition:
                            sediment is depositied
               
                    Base level:
                        lowest point to which a stream can erode

                        2 types:
                            ultimate:
                                sea level

                            local:
                                resistant rocko

                    Incised Meanders:
                        form in streams that flow in steep narrow valleys

                        result when land is uplifted

                    types of stream valleys:
                        narrow:
                            downcutting towards base level

                            rapids and waterfals

                        wide valleys:
                            stream is near base level

                            downward erosion is less dominant

                    Drainage basin:
                        drainage divide / ridge seperates 2 adjacent drainage
                        basins

                        controls which direction water drainage will flow

                        can have nested drainage basino

                        drainage patterns:
                            dictated by the overall landscape, rock types and
                            shit

                            dendritic drainage:
                                looks like branches in a tree. smal streams all
                                end up binding together into a large river

                            radial: 
                                streams flow away in all directions due to some
                                feature like a volcanoe

                            rectangular:
                                straight segments of streams taking on
                                perpendicular directions

                            trellis:
                                tributaries tending in parallel valleys of
                                steeply flooded terrain

                Groundwater:
                    Karst topography:
                        slightly acidic ground water erodes limestone bedrock

                    sinkholes are formed on the surface as the slightly acidic
                    water disolves limestone

                    caves are formed over time from this sink holes.  The water
                    table will eventually drop over time leaving these caves
                    that were once filled by water empty to have stalagmites and
                    shit form inside of them

                Glaciers:
                    as glaciers slowly flow they pick up rocks and deposited
                    elsewere

                wind:
                    particularly present in arid dry climates

                    wind blows and removes finer silts and sand particles and
                    leavese begind larger pebbles and such

                Differential weathering:
                    weathered more in some directions than others


        mass wasting:
            transfer of rock and soil down slope from influence of gravity

            slope stability:
                slope is an open system that is continually seeking a stable
                angle of equillibrium
                
                several conflicting forces:
                    gravity

                    frictional resistance between slope and particles

                    inertia

                    cohesion and internal friction of particles

                parts of slope:
                    upper part (accumulation):
                        bedrock is exposed
                        weathering happens here mostly
                        particles are released by weathering and flow down slope

                    middle (transportation):
                        where particles tend to move from areas of higher slope
                        to lower slope

                        runoff from heavy rainfall can help the particles move
                        more


                    bottom (deposition):
                        mainly fine particles

                    the higher up the slope the coarser the particles, the
                    closer to the bottom the finer

            Role of gravity in slope stability:
                normal component and shear component

            Angle of repose:
                max angle a slope can have and still be stable
                    33 - 37 degrees

                coarse materials can have a steeper slope
                    cohesive materials can also have a steeper slope

                    something that is wet is more cohesive generally
                    too much water can destroy cohesion though

            factors of slope stability:
                discontinuities
                angle of repose
                wettnes

            slope is in dynamic equillibrium
                events like earthqukes can stop the equilibrium

            slope failure:
                * factors:
                    - excess precipitation
                    - sudden shocks
                    - removal of vegetation
                    - changes of land use
                    - overloading of the slope
                    - undercutting by streams or waves

                undercut of a cliff, earthquake activity, slope to steep,
                landslide from heavy rainfall can all lead to slope failure

                classification:
                    type of material
                        either solid rock or unconsolidated material

                    mechanim of movement
                        free fall
                        slide 
                            coherent mass down slope
                        flow
                            incoherent mass down slope

                    rate of movement
                        fast, slow, intermediate

    energy:
        ability of physical system to do work on another system

    Landscape:
        open system with highly variable inputs of energy and materials

        uplift of the land creates a potential energy of position above sea
        level:
        
        energy from the sun drives hydropligic and atmosphereic processes:
            these processes wear down the land surface to lower elevations
            closer to sea level

    Dynamic Equalibrium:
        balancing act between tectonic  uplift and reduction

        landscapes are continually cahnging in 
            rock structure

            climate

            local relief

            elevation
