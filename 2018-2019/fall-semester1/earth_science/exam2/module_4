4a: The Energy Atmosphere System
    air pressure:
        measure using a barometer


    driving forces of the atmosphere
        gravity
        pressure gradient force
            created from pressure difference among locations on earth

            winds tend to move from high to low pressure


        coriolis Force
            since earth is a sphere and rotates on its axis, wind across the
            surface appears to curve

            different directions in hemisphere:
                right in north, left in south

            the winds are moving in a straight line but the seem to curve
            because the earth is rotating, changing the distance from the wind
            to the surface or wherever

            
        Friction Force
            effects of friction on/from wind
            mainly acts near earth's surface
            500m above earth's surface

            variables affecting:
                surface texture
                wind speed
                time of day and year 
                atmospheric conditions

            near surface, friction distrupts equillibrium between pressure
            gradient and coriolis forces, causing:
                generates cyclones
                cyclones

            pressure and coriolis can form wind circles following isobars:
                when you add the frictional force into the mix, these wind
                circles will start to spin inward towards low pressure areas

    Winds and Isobars:
        ways of mreasuring areas of different pressures, like a topographic map
        but for pressure systems

        lines have equal pressure
        
        the closer together isobar lines, the stronger the wind

    wind in high pressure area will sink
    will rise in low pressure, helps with things converging to low pressure
    areas 

    Primary High PRessure and Low Pressure Areas:
        Equatorial low pressure trough (Intertropical Convergence Zone):
            occurs along equator

            along it we have rising warm air caused by an equitorial low
                this creates a low pressure belt known as a trough or the doldrums

            along it the winds converge along the equator and causes that low
            pressure
                this has ver monotonous weather

                the climate as a result is wet year round

            trade winds:
                converge along the equator

                both towards west
                from north in north, from south in south

                <--

            as we move north or south we see wet summers and dry winters


        Subtropical high pressure cells

        subpolar low pressure cells

        polar high pressure cells

4b:
    ITCZ:
        radiates energy into outerspace
        air rises into the tropopause and the rises later to create the
        subtropical high


    Subtropical high pressure cells
        downwelling air becomes very dry because the hair heats up as it sinks

        very gentle winds

        Bermuta High:
            in atlantic ocean

            helps control path of alantic hurricanes

            causes clockwise rotation, causing the westerlies

            Westerlies:
                occur at higher latitudes than trade winds

                in north hemisphere blow from the west towards the northeast

                utilized by sailors returning from europe to north america

            also causes the trade winds that converge along the ITCZ

        all seasons tend to be try


    subpolar low pressure cells
        further north

        in winter, two cells dominate but disappear in the summer:
            pacific and atlantic low

            polar front is the contrast between cold and warm air masses
                creates low pressure cells


        warm air rises over cold air

        as a resultof the conflict between the air masses, all seasons tend to
        be wet


    polar high pressure cells
        cold air sinks towards the surface

        north and southern hemisphere, all the way up or down

        has high pressure, so the cold air forms a clockwise rotation and
        diverges


        is quite small as a whole and recieves little energy from the sun

        all seasons tend to be dry because of the sinking wind


    global winds as a whole:
        11:50 in this video, good video for studying

    circulation around highs and lows:
        in high pressure area:
            air comes together in the sky and sinks down towards the surface, 
            warming in the process.

            in the process this warm air diverges and produces a circular
            pattern in the northern hemisphere

            this air slows towards a low pressure area

        low pressure area:
            the converging warm air on the ground comes from diverging low
            pressure areas

            rises towards the lower levels of the atmosp[here and coolds in the
            process and the diverges

    uper troposhere circulation:
        geostropic winds

        we can construct many isobaric planes that connect points of equal
        atmospheric pressure

        as we go higher we reach planes of less pressure
            the pressure in the regions is given as a unit of the area of the
            plane


        these planes will not be flat, but will contain ridges and groughs

        warm air will have a rise and cool a rough

        by construction these planes we can get a better idea of the uper
        troposhere circulation:
            an isobaric pressure surface for the upper atmosphere undulates
                ridges of high pressure where winds slow and converging (pile
                up) in anticyclonic motion

                troughs of low pressure where winds accelerate and diverge

            high pressure areas again are ridges on the surface
                winds circulate around the high in clockwise (in the north)

                winds descend and then diverge

            low pressure areas form troughs:
                the upper pressure ciculates counter clock around the low
                pressure and a cyclonic motion starts and warm air rises and
                cools forming clouds


    Jet Streams:
        region or band of high winds

        2 major ones:
            1 polar, 1 suytropical
            circle the earth between 30 and 60 degrees latitude

            at elevations in the upper troposhere (whre jets fly)

       wander with the seasons, so have  big effect on the development of
       storms

       the interior can reach 300 km/h at about 7600-10700 m above surface

       caused by rapid change in pressure along the edges of those regions

       tend to be most intense in the winter when the temp difference between
       the mases is the greatest


        Rossby Waves:
            develop along geostropic area in upper troposhere

            bring cold air southward and warm air northwood

            results in distinct cyclonic circulations

            support development of cyclonic storm systems

            sometimes jet streams waver (arent circular) these are known as
            rosby waves:
                they can move in and out

                sometimes this can send circles of cold air out and then return
                to a pretty circular form

    Local winds
        land sea breezes:
            if two nearby regions on the earth's surface are heated
            differently:
                winds result because of the density difference (due to temp
                difference)


            day and night
                during the day, land heats up faster than water
                    pressure surfaces puff up over land, as a result warm air rises
                    over the land, drawing in cooler air form the water

                at night land will cool faster than wayer for pressure surfaces
                will puff up over water:
                    cool air from the land will go towards the water

        mountain-valley breezes:
            during the day:
                valley air heats up rapidly, so the air rises up towards higher
                elevations

            at night air cools rapidly
                cool air subsides down slope into the valley

            air blows up the hill during day and down at night

        katabatic winds:
            stronger and occur on larger scale than mountain valley

            layers of air at the surface of a highland or plateau cools,
            becomes denser adn flows down slope

            santa ana winds of california:
                strong dry winds generated by high pressure over the great
                basic onf west US flow out across the desert towards california

                winds bloing over sierra nevada mountains blows down slope:
                    this is heated and blows faster as it sinks


        Monsoonal WInds:
            long dry seasons in the colder winter are due to stable high
            pressure at center continent

            by mid summer, continental interior heats up, creating low pressure
            area that draws in air from surroundings:
                incoming moist air from the indian ocean brings in a shit ton
                of rains

                flooding can be destructive, but very important for crops

            in the winter, the land area is cooler than the ocean which creates
            high pressure over the land, blowing air towards the ocean,
            resulting in dry land

            then in the summer the land heats up and becomes warmer than the
            ocean, which draws in warm surface winds form the oceans

4c:
    Ocean Watcer Circulation:
        driven by contrasts in temp, composition and density of ocean waters:
            actual pathways are influenced by earth spin

        3 lays in ocean:
            surface water:
                varies in temp

            intermediate water:
                mixing zone between surface and deep

                temp becomes colder significantly with depth
                at bottom, temps are very close to freezing

            deep layer:
                very close to freezing, though very uniform temp

                antartic bottom water from south to north

                north atlandic deep water, from north to south




        during equator heat warms deeper cold water, causing it to rise:
            this water then flows northward

            to the north these currents will begin to cool
                eventually the water in the north will get ver cold and sink
                due to its higher density

                this causes this water to become part of the deep water
                circulation pattern

                results in a counter clockwise mixing of the ocean

        deep ocean water sinks near the poles because of its higher density
            only the freshwater portion of the water freezes, leaving salt
            behind, which results in denser water

            when they get to the bottom layer they flow back towards the
            equator, but move very slow

            Two principle deep water flows:
                North Atlantic Deep Water:
                    originates in the north atlantic and flows southward

                Antartic Bottom Water:
                    deepest

                    flows from antartic to the north


        Surface Waters:
            warmed by the sun's energy

            temperatures vary with both latitude and seasons

            moved horisontally by wind and wave action


        Ocean Currents:
            narrow channels of swift moving surface ocean water:

            move in definite and predictable directions

            distribute heat and nutrients in the ocean


            Corilois Effect on Currents:
                difflects water to right in the northern hemisphere, and to the
                left in the southern hemisphere

                Ekman Spiral:
                    created by the corilois effect

            Gyres:
                ocean currents continually deflected to the right
                    traces out a loop, direction depends on the hemisphere

                Pacific Gyre:
                    flows from california to the west in the sourhten park of
                    the northern hemisphere

                    flows upward from japan towards alaska

                    because it is a gyre it is a circular path, clockwise
                    between japan and NA

            Multiyear Oscillations in Global Circulation:
                several fluctionations ocur in multiyear or shorter periods
                    usually due to changes in strength and/or location of
                    primary high and low pressures

                examples:
                    north atlantic oscillation:
                        positive phase:
                            strong low pressure over iceland and strong high
                            pressure over azores
                            polar jet pulled to the north, cold polar air confined
                            to northern europe

                        negative phase:
                            both icelandic low and azores high weakens:
                                polar stram follows southernly path
                                cold air spills southward

                                makes winters in US and UN much colder


                    pacific decadal oscillation:
                        positive phase:
                            south pacific waters are warmer
                            north pacific colder

                        negative phase:
                            opposite than the positive

                        these last 20-30 years each

                    southern oscillation:
                        Accompanies el nino

                        during normal conditions:
                            have low pressure in western pacific, associated
                            with warm rising air, generating rainfall and cloud
                            formation over southeast asia

                            strong equltorical currents from east to west 

                            this draws up upwelling currents off of the coast
                            of south america, bringing up deep water nutrients,
                            results in good fishing

                        La Nina:
                            normal conditions along the equatorical pacific
                            intensify, trade winds push stronger than normal
                            and farther west

                            results in increasing upwelling of cold water along
                            the eastern pacific coastlinles

                            equatorial waters become cooler than normal

                        region of high presure see-saws from one side of the
                        pacific to the other:
                            when high pressure is in the western pacific,
                            southeasternly trade winds diminsh

                        equatorial surface waters become warmer, we get a
                        current flowing from west to east, this blocks
                        upwelling along the coast of south america, this
                        results in less nutrients and poor fishing

                        this causes drought in australia and south east asia
