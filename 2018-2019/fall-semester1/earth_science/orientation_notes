Textbook:
    Elemental geosystems 9th edition (8th will work) by Christopherson and
    Birkeland

    We also need an sccess code

    it looks like within mastering we can find the access code, without having
    to buy the entire book.


    We do not need the access code if we don't want to do the optional
    assignments.  She says we could get by without the book if we want to try
    and rely on the lecture.

Course in blackboard:
    She says that most up to date messages and such will be at the top of
    the course content page.

Syllabus:
    assigned modules, as well as optional assignments are all on the sylabus

    All of our exam reviews will be in SEC 101

Exam:
    50 multiple choice questions.  We take out exams at the testing center

    The are taken at the CBB testing center

    The 4 exams are pretty much the only thing thats required
    Each exam is 25%.  THe final exam is not comprehensive.

    Scheduling is through casa
    
Orientation Quiz:
    found in the all exams folder
    can take as many times as you want

Learning Modules:
    basically our class meeting
    sound in the learning modules folder
    the module numbers map to the chapter number, the syllabus has which ones
    we need to do and when they are due


    When we open the modules we get a table of contents, it tells us which
    chapter to read and such

    The module will hold the lectures, there is an embedded yooutube video or
    something

    studying the lecture slides are a good way to study

    There are self tests, that are used mostly to see if you have an
    understanding, don't study these

OPtional Assignments:
    The average of these will replace the lowest exam score.  It will not
    replace the final, only one of the first 3

    To do these we have to purchase the access code.

Other assignments:
    assignments are in the modules that we are supposed to do
