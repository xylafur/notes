Michelangelo:
    Sistine Chapel
        functioned as a chapel for the papal court
        smaller space that also functioned as a meeting place

        22-1:
            when originally created, had the scenes on the side (from the perspective
            we see).  Many scenes from the new testament involving jesus and saint
            peter.


        22-17:
            a new pope (julius the 2nd) came in the 1500's and commissioned
            michalangelo to paint the cieling

        
            what is being depicted:
                the creation of the world
                the flood

                a cronology of scenes, from the creation of the universe to the
                'dunkenness'? of noah

                Old testament stuff in the middle with some pagan stuff around the
                sides

            sibyls:
                female pagan preachers essentially

                why in this painting?
                    there were literary texts in which it was claimed that the
                    pagan worls had some inate understanding of the messiah


                    both christian and pre christian uniting in this understanding
                    of th messiah

            and down below on the walls we have many more new testament scenes

            possible origin:
                midevil church in france that had a similar getup, pagan things on
                the side of the cieling with old testament things in the center

        22-18:
            towards the center of the images

            the idealized nude:
                adam is a bit beefier than some of michelangelo's earlier
                sclptures, such as david

                most likely an influence from ancient roman sculptures

            the pose:
                odd, god on one side adam on the other, touching eachother in the
                middle

                most earlier artists had represented this scene in a much different
                fashion

                not a whle lot of drama in earlier works

            in the renisaunce there is this idea of the genius of the artist, a
            gift from god and such

    22-19:
        Done after the cieling of the chapel.  Michealangelo continued to work for
        various popes

        See this new view creeping into his art:
            we see saint barthalamew (22-1c) (who was an early christian saint who
            had been skinned alive)

            we see him hlding his own flaied skin
                the face on the skin bares resimblance to self portiats of
                michealangelo

        at this time there was this movemnt int he christian religion
            probably because of things like the prodestant refromation going on

            such things as aversion to nudity

            the popes hired some people after the fact to paint loin cloths over
            the 'nude' elements of this painting (and other paintings)
                when this piece was cleaned there was debate around removing the
                'underwear'

Raphael:
    least known of the big renisaunce painters

    leonardo and michelangelo were both known for their stereotypical "troubled
    artist"
        Raphael as just a fucking normie.  Down to earth, sympathetic artist.

    HE played around with many different artistic influences
        eventually you can see him absorm some of the influences of leonardo

    22-7
        altar piece, image of wedding.



    22-8
        reminds us a bit of the virgin of the rocks

        there obsiously is not that dark scene (stomato), this is more birght
            though he claims there is an element of leonardo


        we see a sort of pyramidial form

    22-9:
        Raphael comes to rome.  Julius the 2nd, in addition to getting
        michealengelo to do the chapel, he commisions raphael to do a series of
        frescos in the halls of the vatacan palace
            there were a series of halls (4 of them) and julius commissioned
            raphael to decorate each of these halls

        various figures from greek philosophy:
            we see plato and aristotle in the middle
