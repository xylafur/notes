Raphael: (continued)
    22-9:
        The sad guy in front left of plato is Heraclitus:
            He has this idea of melencoloy
                this is a common theme in raphael

        This may be a kind of portrait of both Heraclitus and Michelangelo

        Plato has come resemblance to Leonardo
            it is often thought among art historians that many of the
            significant figures are portiats of other painters from the time

        All of these philosopers are from different periods of greek history,
        so this is all kind of imaginary


        The way that this painting is set up in the room, it is surrounded by
        many other grand frescos
            These pintings all hold the theme of
                philosopy, theology, poetry and justice prudence

        the painting facing this one from the other side of the room is one of
        christian theology (disputa)
            this can almost be seen as the 'reconciliation of heaven and earth'

            the difference between disputa and the school of athens can be seen
            as:
                the ideal vs the real

Mnnerism and Venetion Painting:
    in  the context of 16th century italian art
        we are going beyond the generation of leonardo, raphael, ..

    We will discuss "mannerism"
        not an organized artistic movement the term itself would not have made
        sense to people at the time

        wasn't related with a particular period

        relates to a word that was used at the time "maniera", meaning style,
        manner
            it was used to refer to the style of particular artists

            can also be used in an absolute sense as a positive attribute, for
            instance saying some artists have more maniera than others

        Glorgio Vasari argued:
            artists of his time (especially michelangelo) was different than
            the earlier renisaunce not because the paintings are more realistic
            but because they are more stylish.
        
        we see extremley idealized figures
        visual complexity
            we see these types of paintings with intertwined characters and
            sort of abstract stylishness

        style that was a self concious departure from the previous renisance:
            these painters wanted to do their own thing

            high renisance was this mesh of idealized and realism

            manerists went overboard with stylishness and idealization
                stopped looking at nature, rather just eachother paintings and
                building upon that

                almost antagonistic to the high renisance

        people of this style weren't trying to throw away the classical but
        rather have a new take on the classical or discover aspects of the
        classical that was not previously aknowledged

    22-45:
        This painter did all sort of paintings

        the old man is father time

        the allegory of this painting is that time reveals all human follies
            he's revealing all of the sexual thoughts / follies in cupid
            we see him strangley fondling his mother venus

        There is alot of manerism in this, the idealized figures, strange
        complexity of the paitning

        The way that all of the people are standing / displayed:
            shows the idealized nude, there really is no purpose for the reason
            they are standing - its just almost as if their posing

        This painting is also very flat:
            
    22-42:
        We see religious paintings in this mannerist style

        italian painter from flourence

        The theme is sort of the same subject as rojer van der widen, the
        compassion of the virgin

        the composition is this strange swirling visually complicated painting
            very elongated figures

    22-44:
        has the nickname "modona of the long neck"

        we see the idealized elongation of the figure
            christ is stretched out, hands are elongated and such

        a sort of motif from many pieces of this period:
            what seems to almost be an eroticized aspect of even sacred images

            could just be the result of idealization, she seems to be a more
            courtly lady rather than the virgin
                clinging fabric which is somewhat sexualized

        a note on prodestant refromation:
            the problems with some religious art at the time is that it is very
            lasciviousness
                paintings should not be painted with a seductive charm

            many in the churh are saying that the figure being painted for altar
            pieces are to beautiful, to distracting

            this is definitely a product of the manerist style

    Most of the artists we were dicussing were coming out of flourence and rome

    Venice has its own sort of style
        history going back to the early middle ages

        very distinct culture and dialect within italy

        refered to as a republic
            there was a very intrensic aristocracy, led by a duke who led for a
            time and always came form aristocratic families

        very distinct architecture:
            alot of byzantine influence

    22-32:
        giovanni bellini

    FILL ME IN:
        Secred Converstion:
            refers to the composition type with virgin and child in the middle
            and saints on either side

        

    22-35:
        We don't know for sure if Titian did this painting or not
            probably Titian though

        Have two female figures
            one drawing water form well

            other holding recorder or flute

            both in the classical nude

        male figures:
            both are clothed

            one holding a lute

        peasant in the back ground:
            playing a sort of bagpipe instrument

        what do the women represent?:
            pagan?
                the nudity suggests that they are imagined

        these seems to be assiciated with a style known as pastoral poetry
            literary tradition that is typically having to do with shepeards

            set in teh country side, poet describes the setting of landscape in
            detail, basically nature poetry

            connected to the theme of music

            related to landscape paintings in the anicient period
        
        the landscape is significant, we haven't seen a significant landscape
        painting since that one allegory of justice painting
            the early 16th century (where we are now) is when we start to see
            landscape as a common subject
