$ Peter Paul Rubens
    - Based in Antword, southern netherlands.

    - Does alot of big altar pieces as well as large secular pices such as the
      potrtiats for royalty and shit


    @25-2
        - Though its the cruxifiction, Christ is represented in a very heroic way
            - almost as if its the reserection rather than the cruxifiction

    @25-4:
        - After the wedding between Marie and Henery
            - Henry was to busy to come to his own wedding
        - This is of the Medici family getting on a boat to go to Marseilles
            - we see neptune and nymphs who are accompying or guiding her on her
              ocean/ boat journey

            - The female figure in the blue robe is supposed to be a
              representation of France

            - all of this mixing of real and mythological figures as well as
              alegorical figures
                - very complex iconography
                - deigned to promote Marie de' Medici
                    - part of her political program / propoganda


* There is a big difference between Northern and Southern Netherlands
    - religious and other differences

    - the conflict between the dutch (northern netherlands) and the spanish
        - there was a war going on (or had been going on earlier)
        - political, economic policies and such
        - religion got caught up in the process
            - the dutch became increasingly prodantesized society in the sense
              that there was a mass migration from the southern netherlands to
              the north, consisting of prodestants
                - Catholasism was shunned in the northern netherlands
                - there were other prodestant groups such as the prodestnts
                - the calvanists were very against the altar piece
                    - they thought of altar pieces as idols
                    - altar pieces taken out and even destroyed
                    - did not mind religious images in other contexts such as in
                      their homes, but just not in their churches

Hendrick ter Brugghen:
    - Lived in the city of Utrech 
    - prodestant

    @25-7:
        - this reminds us of caravagio's saint matthew
            - ter Brugghen's painting is not near as dark
            - you only see the top half of the figures
            - the way that christ is pointing towards Matthew and Matthew is
              pointing towards himself
                - very similar to Caravaggio's painting
            - ter BRugghen had been in rome and saw Caravagio's works
                - then he came back to the netherlands and continued his carrer

            - one main thing that is different is the size.  Caravaggio's
              painting is huge, ter Brugghen's painting is very small.

        - christ and saint peter are on the left side of the painting, saint
          mathew in blue with the beard

        - not designed for a church, was just for a private collection

       
Gerrit van Honthorst:
    Alot of people from Utrech (where he is from) is catholic (even though it was
    not popular in the northern Netherlands).  Generally catholics were a
    minority but just barely in some cities

    Also worked in england for part of his carrer

    @25-8:
        - done while he was in italy
        - very caravaggio esce
            - a fad among people that did this stuff, got obsessed with candle
              light
            - the itallians called him Gerrit of Night
        - all of these figures around a table drinking and singing or whatever
            - everyone is dressed pretty fancy
                - feathered caps and nice clothes and shit
                - like the figures around saint matthew in his calling of saint
                  matthew painting
                - also like the card sharps by caravggio

        - we see the young woman with the older lady next to eachother like
          caravaggio's judith beheading holofernes
            - this place might be a brothel
        - you could say that this is a genre painting
            - the costumes are contemperary
            - also the possible connection with biblical

            - this becomes a very common iconography in dutch art

$ Jan Steen:
    Getting away form utrich
    Dutch paintiner who lived in various dutch cities (moved around).

    ALot of his paintings are very satirical
        alot of out of control families
            mom and dad are falling down drunk
            cat eating their food
            etc
        the dutch have a proverb for families that are like this are called a
        Jan Steen family

    @25-20:
        - December 6th is the feast of St Nicolas
            - in dutch culture the feast of St Nicolas is distinct from saint
              nicolas

            - gift giving was part of this, not christmas

        - middle class family
            - the northern netherlands at this time was pretty economically
              prosperous
                - nicknamed the golden age
                - the dutch blockaded a port
                    - alot of trade flowing into amsterdam
                - in 1648 they signed a peace treaty with spain and that ended
                  the war
                    - the dutch were functioning as their own country in the
                      early 17th century though
        - older woman in background
            - she is pulling back the curtain, looking towards the boy thats
              crying
            - probably an implication that they're giving the boy a hard time
                - the grandma is kinda calling him towards the back

$ Johannes Vermeer:
    - not many paintings by this guy
        - they think he might have just been a slow worker
        - his paintings are very high quality and worked out

        - he was finiancially supported
            - his parents owned banks or something
            - he married a rich woman
                - she was catholic
                - he seems to have converted

    @25-18C:
        - In comparission to Steen (who does middle class scenes), Vermeer's
          paintings seem to represent more upper class families

        - we are kind of voyers to this painting
    
        - this woman is holding a letter
            - she is looking up at the maid servant
            - we assume that the letter has just been delivered

        - paintings on the wall
            - both of which are landscape paintings

            - the boat:

        - Terms the dutch used to apply to paintings like this
            - Antiek:
                - biblical or classical / ancient subject

            - Modern:
                - contemperary scene
