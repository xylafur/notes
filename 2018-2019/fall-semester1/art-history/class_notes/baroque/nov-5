24-16:
    Ceiling of this room that is now the French embassy in Rome.
        it was designed partly by Michealengelo himself

    This depicts the various love affairs of the Grecko-Roman Gods
        Alot of the souces come out of the metamorphasis


    Quadro Riportato:
        refers to the style, literally transported picture.  As if a art gallery
        had magically been transported to the ceiling of this building

        ripotata:
            to carry or transport

        quadro:
            like a picture

        di sotto in su:
            seems to be an illusinistic extention of the room itself.


        the systine chapel ceiling, this one and many more chapels/ palaces in
        rome have this same decoration

    This seems like an odd transition for this artist


    Everything is illusinistically painted:
        he paints frames and fake sculptures around the boundaries of the images

    There is a basic naturallism that still expresses itself:
        but instead of manerist jigsaw pieces and people dramatically posed,
        visual confusion there is a very straightforward image

        Simple composition, simply modeled, shading is straight forward and 3
        dimensional

    We see again the 'nudi'
        simmilar to michalengelo with the nudes and the bronze medalians

        its so simmilar that it is likely purpusfully a nudge or reference to
        michalengelo
            he is trying to inscribe himself into local art history (sistine)

        There is significant detail in the figures:
            in this one (compared to michelangelo) there is more of a self
            concious naturallism

            if you look at the figures they are lit from below, and the light on
            the medallian is coming from another direction

            this light comes from the windows in the room.
                the building is right on some river that flows thorugh rome

                the windows look out onto the river and light comes in

                The artist is playing with this idea.  Different levels of
                reality.  The sculptures and the nude figures are supposed to be
                in our space and the light from the window casts shadow on them

                The medallian and other images are not this way though, they
                have their own sources of light

    Artists at this time are becoming intwined with naturalism again

    - The central scene in this painting is the bacas and ariani:
        - a princess that the roman bacas falls in love with

        - in their chariot they are being followed by the followers of dyonisis

        - the theme of the ceiling is love

    It was thought that this may have been related to a mairrage that happened
    between some important person of this palace
        now adays it seems that the tendency among scalars is that there wasn't
        a direct connection with the wedding

    This does seem to be connected to Raphael's Galatea
        in this famous ren building called the Vlla Famesina

        In the earlier 16th century, this was owned by the kigi family who used
        it as a country palace

        all of the paintings here are mythological subjects


        there was a plan (awhile after the Femesina purchased this building) to
        connect this building to the one that we were checking out earlier by a
        private bridge.

Carravagio:
    Painting with the 2 boys and other man playing card:
        by Carravagio, he is pretty unknon at this time

        this is called a genre painting.
            it portrays a particular scene with generic figures that are doing
            some sort of thing, in this case a card game

        the guy in the back is tipping off the guy int eh back to what cards the
        one guy hasJk

        supposed to be a sort of ammusing scene

    Carravagio begins to get recognition after he does alot of the genre
    paintings
        eventually he starts to get commisioned for more glamorous things such
        as altar pieces

    Inspiration of saint matthew
        the first painting was refused by the patron and he had to do a second
        one

        the first painting was destroyed in ww2

    24-18:
        calling of saint matthew

        oil on canvas, the canvas is glued to the wall
            this was a very common of interior decoration, especially in
            northern italy

            there were some frescos in this region, but there was this long
            tradition of oil paintins

            the humid climate of this region was not good for frescos
            
        saint matthew is suppoed to have been a jewish tax collector
            he's seated at the table with his tax collection buddies, cointing
            their coins and shit on the table

            they're all dressed in fancy contemparary costumes

        christ is standing to the right, gesturing saint matthew calling him to
        be a follower
            saint matthew is like the fuck, me?

        the direction of the light reinforces the gesture of christ
            carravagio's paintings were overall dark with the light acting as a
            sort of spotlight


        the pointing gesture:
            seems to be a duotation of the hand of adam

        Carravagio was viewed as the radical naturalist
            suppoed ot have gone to far in the direction of naturallism

            increddibly sophisticated, moving away from the manerism towards
            a very naturalistic style, though never leaving behind the idea of
            beauty
