@25-8:
    Part of a traditiion where artists travel to rome and pick up on the style
    of caravagio

Most of the art was for private collections, this comes from the dutch generally
being opposed to religious imagery in churhes

Vermeer was similar to Steen in the sense that he painted 'genre' paintings.
Vermeer was more upper class situatins where Steen was more common man

Genre painting in general developed with the 17th century dutch and became a
very popular subject matter
    there are various different subvarieties of genre:
        upper class
        lower class
        etc

    the dutch at this time would have called them modern paintings
        where people are dressed in contemperary costume
        supposed to be of the contemperary time

    Portriats were also very popular subject matter for dutch artists at this
    time

$ Frans Hals: 
    - Lived in Harlem - very important dutch city
    - portriatest: did almost entierly portriats
        - one of the features of dutch painting at this time was for painters to
          specialize in specific subjects.
            - for instance steen did mostly genre paintings of middle class
              families
        - his potriats are very well known for their vibrant depicition of
          figures, the facial expressions and brush work
            - possibly partly derives from venician works

    @ 25-10:
        - Group portriat of a militia company
            - dutch tradition of these malitia companies aka civil guards
            - existed in most dutch cities
                - not exclusive to the dutch

            - Main form of protection at this time

            - had kind of evolved to a sort of social organization at this time
                - the real conflicts were mostly fought by mercenary armies,
                  many not even dutch

            - There were traditions of painting the officers from these
              companies and then hanging the painting in their headquarters
                - this would be done at the time of the banquets they would
                  throw


$ Judith Leyster
    - There were a number of female dutch painters.
    - She was probably a student of Hals
        - Had a workshop, students etc
        - her husband was also trained by Hals

    - mostly did genre paintings

    @ 25-11:
        - almost like there is an interaction between her and the person in her
          painting
            - there was a kind of theme of the interaction of art and music
       
# Landscape Paintings

$ Jacob van Ruisdel:
    - painter who was originally from Haarlem, though moved to amsterdam
    
    - only did landscape paintings

    @ 25-18:
        - This was done while he lived in amsterdam
        - see a church in the background
            - big midevil church in Haarlem

        - an example of the imagery of the local landscape
            - very important in 17th century dutch art

            - Alot of landscape paintings do not relate to where the paintiner
              lives - they were meant to represent some specific scene or
              something

                - elements of the landscape were taken from various places,
                  based on literal places but not actually representing places

            - Thie painting is topographically very specific, it is very clearly
              the countryside outside of Haarlem

        - there may be a patriotic connotation associated with this painting

- Something noteworth with these 17th century landscape
    - no longer associated with the religious or biblical naratives

- Art at this time was mostly an open market
    - the churches were not commissioning anymore

    - a painter specializing was a way of assuring market share for that artist
        

# Still Life Paintings

- At this time you see the idea of still life emerging
    - possibly based on ancient references of still life
        - andicnet greek and romans with still life objects

    - in the 17th century
        - there is a similar phenomena with still life and landscape
            - there is no longer a religious narative associated wiht the
              paintings
            - still life becomes a subject purley on its own

    - In some still life paintings
        - the objects might have certain associatinos

$ Pieter Claesz
    @ 25-21:
        - different kind of still life painting
        - a collection of objects
            - vilolin
            - human skull
            - upturned goblet
            - cracked walnut
            - pocketwatch
            - snuffed out lamp
            - reflective metal sphere
                - we see the artist, window and some of the obejct in the
                  painting
                - remincant of the arlafini wedding by van eick

        - WHat is all this shit?
            - Vanitas (in the title of the painting)
                - comes from the bible
                - vanity of vanities, all is vanity
                    - everyting on earth ends
                    - though the spirit remains

            - a meditation on transience, and death
                - music is associated with the vanitas theme
                    - the notes of the instruments are struck, but the music
                      dies after it is played


            - the idea of vanitas comes from older visual traditions
                - in other vanitas still life images there is a latin phrase
                  that is often quoted
                    % Life is brief but art is long
                - painting becomes a symbol of things beyond death
            
            - its significant that Claesz includes himself in thie allegory
                - he is saying that he himeself will die

$ Willem Kalf
    - paintiner who lived in amsterdam in the middle part of the 17th century
    - did a kind of still life paintings
        - a term used "Pronk" still ife
        - which means like a showpiece
            - elaborate

    @ 25-22:
        - the objects in this painting here would have been understood not as
          local objects but as imported things
            - chinese porcelien
            - turkish rugs

        - a large number of self portraits

    - very engaged with religious subjects

            - paintined towards the end of his carreer

        - he transformed from a very tight articulated style to a brushy kind of
          style
