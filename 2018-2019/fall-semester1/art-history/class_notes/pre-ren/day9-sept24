Exam 1 which was scheduled for wednesday will now be on october 3rd, a week
from this wednesday

In talking about 15th century itallian art in comparision of the previous
period:
    as we get into the 15th century, the reference to the classical or the
    'antique' becomes more explicit

    for giotto, part of what he was doing (along with others from that period)
    in created a more naturalistic style had to do with going back to the
    classical tradition
        for giotto, the classical was a bit remote

        the connection in the classical become overt and self conscious

21-11:
    David was a representation of flourence itself, goliath was one of the
    neighboring states that had a goliath like art

21-5:
    There were limits to the nude, could not represent saint mark this
    christian saint in the nude

    though you can see the contra pasta

21-6:
    another by donatello of a patron saint patron

    we see that this one is not in the contra pasta, but is more upright

    saint george was an early christian saint, in a story he was told to have
    rescued a maiden from a dragon
        he is often depicted as a chivilrus night

        in this sculpture, he used to hold a sword in his right hand, but it
        was lost

    Things you start seeing in the early renissance:
        sudle emotional expression, psycologically intense face

        though its hard to determine the actual emotion, the sculpture seems
        psycologically alive


        this seems very distinctive in the renisance

        these is more and more nod to the individual experience

21-15:
    This is a different reference to the classical

    another bronze, life sized figure

    condottiero:
        a mercenary soldier

        in the renissance there was no general conscription, armies were
        generally professional soldiers, mercenaries

        some of them became associated with a particular cities, and became
        heros or some sort
            their families could become aristocratic after some time in this
            case

    the figure on horseback is based on one sculture
        sculpture of marcus aurellus

        this is the only equestrian bronze statue that survived
            generally over centeries the statues would be melted down into
            cannon balls or whatever

21-16:
    another of the condottiero statues

    a bit later than the donotello

    he was a local venician condottiere

    the face interesting:
        eyes bugging our, furocious

        supposed to express war like philosphy

    his name is close to coglioni, like nuts

21-27:
    flourintine artist, domenico ghirlandalo

    there are increasing number or portriats at this time, which fits into the
    stereotypes of the renissance as the time of the individual

    Alberti:
        an architect and writer form the renisance raves on about this
        painting
        
    there was this question at this time:
        can the painter only represent the physical of the individual or can
        they represent even more, the essence of the individual

    there is a poem from an acient roman named Martial:
        in the writing he is talking about a portriat that he had where he
        says that basically act can not capture the soul of a person, and that
        the soul is even more beautiful that the physical


21-17:
    deeper into painting, beyond just the classical connection

    the italian equivalent of the international gothic style is this painting

    this was an altar piece done for a very wealthy family
    
    we see christ as a baby and the virgin mary along with the 3 wise men,
    represented with all of their nice shit

    kind of reminds us of that calendar by the limberge brothers

    this look was a very common artistic style in this period

though something different comes in the next paintingo

21-18:
    Massaccio

    he departed from the international style that is more naturalistic, though
    simpler and stripped down.  Not alot of decoration as you would get in the
    international style

    this is in a chapel
