Still talking about northern european art

20-15 and 14-13:
    the limberg brothers on the left is more of a secular version of the one
    on the right.

    The figures are simmilar, as far as their elongated appendages and such
        comes about as a result of paintings that people are bringing from
        italy to northern europe

        this leads to a mix of styles known as the international gothic style

20-15 and 1413-16
    this are both from the calendar that the brothers were commissioned to
    create for that king

    each month was supposed to be a scene relating to something in that month
        we see both aristocracy and peasantry

        pesants are usually seen doing labour

        the aristocracy are seen relaxing

    both of these are unfinished, again likely because of the death of the
    patron who was commissioning it

20-4:
    It seems that alterpieces developed much earlier in southern europe, there
    is much speculation as to why this is
        many prodestant traditions considered the altar piece a form of idol
        worship

        our professor thinks that its likeley we just lost many of the earlier
        ones, haven't been able to find them
            his arguemnt is this one in particular, it is very detailed but it
            is one of the earliest we know of.  It doesn't seem to make sense
            that this great piece just came out of no where
    
        the author / artist behind this piece is debated, modernly they
        consider it to be by robert campin

    This is a scene of the virgin mary being told by gabriel that she is gonn
    a have the jesus baby
        the people to the left are speculated to be the patrons

    the guy on the right:
        saint joseph, father of jesus
        depicted as an older man, much older than mary

        the things he's making seem to be mouse traps
            which we ask why is he building that of all things

            there is an argument that the mouse traps relate to a quote by
            saint augistine in which he compares the crusifiction of christ to
            a mousetrap
                compares the devil to a mouse

                the cross of the lord was the mousetrap, the death of the lord
                was the bait

20-5:
    by an artist named jan van eyck and hubert who were two brother painters
    who were based in ghent but moved around a bit
        in the early 1920s the older brother was commissioned to do this altar
        piece.

        He died soon after beginning on it, his younger brother then took over

        the statue on the left is saint john the baptist, indicated by the lamb
        he holds, then on the right of him is saint john the evangalist

20-6:
    a different view ofthe same altar piece, this is when it is open

    obviously alot of color and detail

    at the top:
        god in the center, ambigious if it is chirist of the father
        to his left the virgin mary and saint john the baptist to his right
            this is known as the dyesis: christ, the virgin mary and saint john
            the baptist
        angels and adam and eve to the far sides

        h
many of the northern european pieceis we will discuss:
    are considered a 'netherlandic' piece, modern day belgium
