    basically everything in 13th - 14th century arts is religious paintings
        mostly fresco alter pieces

    14-17:
        The piece in its entierty is the alegory of good and bad gov't
            virtues and vices contrasted between peaceful city and the wall
            right to the left of it.  Peaceful city being good government and
            the other wall being bad

        An image of sienna itself

        see the building beign build, possibly metephorical for the government
        building good things?

    14-18:
        see the wall protecting the city as well as the country side outside of
        the city

        can see aristocrats leacing the city, going out hunting with falcons
            beyond them walking you see people with large bags probably going
            to market

        Both the image of the city and the country side present the viewer with
        prosperous society

        The angel is holding a man hanging from the gallows
            she is probably refering to justince in the allegory of good
            government

    We see the first example of something not completley religious, doesn't
    seem to be religious at all actualy


    Sienna was not just a city, but more so an entire state - so the peice
    all together is a portriat of the city and its surrounding landscape

    Landscape doesn't really become big until the 16th century, during the
    renisance 
        the landscape in this case isn't independent, it appears as a part of
        the larger allegory of the good/bad government.  He's saying that this
        wouldn't really be a landscape piece per-say

powerpoint 3:
    We are switching to northern Europe rather than southern/ italy region 
    20-2:
        Sluter was originally Dutch, one of many artists from northern
        netherlands who were 'following the money' so to speak

        the horns on his head are from a misranslation about when moses came
        abck with the 10 commandments.  He had rays of light emmiting from him
        that looked likle horns but was taken as him having horns


    Again in europe at this time there is this whole movement towards realizm
    in paintings and art in general
    Sources of the realism are mysterious:
        in itally there is a sense of the classical origins from the early
        christian pieces

        in the north it isnt so much from clssical origins (since there weren't
        as many classical pieces/ artists? in that area)

        In the 15th century the classical (greek/roman) origins become much
        more clear and we will discuss it further

    
    20-15:
        manuscript that was decorated and the possesion of the duke of berry,
        brother of philip the bold (a member of french royal family)
        he had a group of profesional manuscript illuminators called the lumbrig
        brothers (a family of dutch 3 bothers john paul and hermin who
        imigrated to france).

        each month of this book would be illistrated with a scene of something
        that would occur inthat month - so this one is a sort of fair
