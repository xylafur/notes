Paper:
    we have the two images that are iconographically the same

    the idea of the paper though is to compare 15th century northern europe and
    italy


    the itallian one has more classical components, less detailed than the
    realism of the northern

power point 4

21-18:
    The artist says:
        that one of the aspects of painting is the artists ability
        to be able to depict emotional states of the people he is painting

        painting should be considered on par with the liberal arts: should be
        considered as a more intellectially elevated profession, rather than
        simply a skilled craft as it was in the middle ages
            it is an activity of the mind

            "[the painter] will make hinself one wit poets and orators"

    Alberti (the artist) was also an architect, he designed the front of the
    church shown in 21-36A

21-20:
    A wall fresco along one of the walls in the church 21-36A

    surrounding the scene of the crucifiction is a roman arch that is supposed
    to show victory or being triumpant

    this is especially famous for its mathematically consistent 1 point
    perspective scheme
        you can tell in the lines of the architecture and such that they all
        seem to move towards the vanishing point at the foot of the cross

        one point perspective:
            now adays school children learn how to do, converging railroad
            tracks and such

        some of the other images we have looked at from earlier such as the
        arlefini double portriat by yan van eick:
            in that painting you can see the lines of the roof/rafters and how
            the receede towards a particular vanishing point

            you can see in earlier paintings that the artist had some implicit
            understanding of a vanishing point but its not always
            mathematically consistent:
                outside of massaccio, the earlier stuff before him, if you plot
                out lines you see multiple vanishing points

                its only in flourence where you see the development of a
                single, percise vanishing point in the horizon

        this is called **Linear perspective**
            there have been other things such as 2 point perspective and such,
            but the idea of linear perspective seems to appear in flourence in
            the 1420's: masaccio being one of the first to put it into practice

        this spreads, and other people in flourence begin picking up this
        style:
            it takes awhile for northern europe to start doing this, around the
            end of the 15th century

    here masaccio says:
        painting is like a poem, painting is like a window (which we can see in
        his perspectives)

        he says that a painter must be learned in all the liberal arts but
        mostly geometry - painting has a mathematical component to it and this
        helps his thesis that painting is also a liberal art

        on the antique:
            people in this time were not just about immitating the ancients but
            rather they believed in emulating and besting the antique:
                they wanted to learn from the ancients, but also outdo them

            masaccio identifies perspective as something unknown even by the
            ancients



   21-48:
    This perspective revolution has influenced many other itallians (and other
    europeans) in the 15th century, this is one example from northern italy

    fresco

    there is a painted vaulted ceiling

21-49:
    this is the oculous, leterlaly the opening of the valut

    little cupid figures
        comedic element with 2 of them having their heads stuck in the railing

    we can see that this is very proper perspectively
   
An Interlude about Iconography:
    everything except the portriats has been religious, sacred themes

21-1:
    this painting is an iconic image, the birth of venus (the godess of love)

    peronifications of the wind on the left, and the nymph on the right who is
    welcoming venus with a cloak

    in the pagan mythological texts, they were not considered contradictory to
    christian faith:
        they were not considered images of literal belief in these gods

        there were considered symbolic or allegories

        the humanists who enjoyed this, considered themselves christian
        humanists:
            though there are exceptions, people who departed from traditional
            christian beliefs

    this seems to be connected to the mettachi family, the same peoeple who
    ordered donachellos david sculpture
    
    we see the connection between teh venus in this picture and the ancient
    venus:
        the modest venus
        venus can be interpreted in many ways, sometimes goddess of
        sensual/sexual/earthly desire though plato spoke of the
        heavenly/celestial venus who was love directed towards god

        the 2 venuses, eartly and heavenly

    neo-platanism:
        new platonic philosphy

        comes from platos philosophy of love and its possible relation to
        christianity
