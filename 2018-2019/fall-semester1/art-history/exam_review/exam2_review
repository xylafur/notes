23-12: 
    when historians recount Bosh they think he was part of some herretical
    religious sect called the atomites.  This image is a kind of altar piece of
    that sect.  (This is no longer accepted by art historians)
        our professor asserts that though this is unusla it is traditional
        christian art in the sense that there is the original sin of adam and
        eve in the left 

        the middle piece is the scene of damnation

    its very unlikely that this was actually an altarpiece

    this was part of an art collection in someones palace

    the art collection movement of the renisance also included collecting
    odities.
        this painting is an example of that odditiy

        this whole idea is very distinctly renisance
            paintings and such from this period are works of art that don't
            visually relate tot eh italian renisance necasarilly, but rather
            the culture of the renisance with the painter as an elevated genius

    this painting is sort of a meta altarpiece
        though never intended to function as one

        it was intended to just  be visually surprising/ unusual

23-18:
    we see another example of a landscape from italy
        the painter is netherlandish

    We have saint jerome in the front of the pictures
        he was one of the famous latin 'church fathers' who lived in the early
        christian period.

        There was a story told about him
            he was very against pleasures, the whole christian virtues and
            depriving the senses to get closer to god.  The anti neitzshe

            he went and created a hut and lived there to focus on his spiritual
            meditations

            there is a crucifix and a skull in his hut.

            there is a story about him and a lion that has a thorn in its paw,
            he removes the thron and the lion becomes his pet

    some of patenir's paitnings were altar pieces
        though most of his were landscapes, he did do some altar pieces

    this painting was in a private art collection
        made for that purpose


    In comparison to Titan's Pastoral Symphony:
        Pastoral Symphony was one of the first landscape paintings from this
        time

        He asserts Patenir's Landscape can be viewed as a christian pastoral
        piece
            there is this idea of encountering god in nature, this is what
            saint Jerome was about and probably what this image is about.

            There is a conrtast between city and conutryside

        In the case of clasical pastoral literature (like pastoral symphony)
            a sort of sexualized pastoral idea, very different than the
            religious theme of this landscape painting

        World Landscape:
            term coined later by art historians that refers to the fact that
            many of these 16th ventury northern landscape are in the format
            where you are looking down from a birds eye perspective

            We see saint jerome turning down the pleasures of this world (when
            viewd from this world landscape context)


23-15:
    this is an example of the artist  ... he trailed off
        this is a reference to still life paintings?

        a painter of vulgar subjects (common subjects)
            these paintings sold for even more, very popular, appealed to the
            realism.  Illusionistic / hyper realistic style

            the still life is a sort of humble style, not a grand narative,
            just an image of still life objects and the humility of it


        This may have insigted intrest in northern europe as well as italy
            these 'humanists' were everywhere

    We have a butchers market here, all the sausages and shit
        mostly carniverous

        in the background there is a detail through the little window slit
        thing:
            there seems to be the story of the flight into egypt
                the holy family goind into exile in egypt during the period
                where they were trying to mssacre the messiah

                these are always depicted with joseph leading the virgin mary
                on a donkey holding baby jesus

                the virgin is giving almonds or bread or something to the poor


            how does all this relate to the still life of meat?
                glutony vs the idea of the eucaris or virgin giving bread in
                the back.  The contrast.

    In the backgrond to the right we see a banquet or something

23-20:
    This painting was a part of a series, there were 5 of theme

    these are paintings of the months of the year
        they are all landscape paintings that depict activities that are done
        during those seasons

        these are fairly sized paintings, not small like the limburg brothers

    His landsape is a combination of different motifs and views of nature

    Some of this guys other pieces you can see depictions of peasants:
        these are not for peasants but just of peasants

        the painter was a "sophisticated upper middle class character"

23-19
    This guy Holbein was a friend of martin luther, religious figure

Power points 5-7

Lenoardo:
    sfumato:
        muted hues and colors, smoky veil or shadow over the composition

    intrest in nature

    new compositional structure:
        more of a pyramid of peopld, unified composition, figures are
        dynamically interacting rather than being lined up

    his style was so dependent on oil patinting:
        he did a mixture of oil and tempra

    He created these complex visual compositions:
        he would sketch them out, study the composition of the painting

    the mona lisa:
        portriat of flourentie lady
        
        suttle psycological engagement

Michelangelo
    David as a political symbol, symbol of flourence
        placed in front of the town hall
        may have aquired the political significance, was probably not intended
        to be that way

        The has not only become the old testament of david but also
        michalangelos own artistic genius
            he does a sketch of david and compares david to himself

    New conception of the Nude
        when he comes from flourence there is this new idea of the nude that
        comes from the classical roman

    God creating adam:
        the unusal compositional focus on the had of god and the hand of adam

    He refers to the hand as the poetic image, the thing of creation

    The analogy of human creation and divine creation
        all earthly beauty is a reflection of the divine
        
        the artist is increasingly as a mystical being comunicating with god

        cult of genius in the renisance

    in his later years he came increasingly pius in a traditional christian
    sense

Raphael:
    Style of leonardo and michalangelo in some ways

    School of athens:
        he depicts himself

        part of this larger piece on the walls and shit of this one chapel

    
There is this broader theme of art from this time becoming self referential
    the artists like to make shit about themselves alot

    The allure or celebrity of the artist themselves
