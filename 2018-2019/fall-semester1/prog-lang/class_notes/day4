Two big themes in the course:
    Functional Programming:
        significantly different than imperitive procederal

    OOP:
        would definitely fall in the same broad category as imperitive and
        procederal

    And if these two can be used together (they can to some extent)


Python and how it relates to what he wants from the homework:
    recursive
        he wants to see linear tail recursion

    lists

Recursion:
    Linear Recursion:
        only make a single recursive call

    Tail Recursion:
        we build up the stack and then evaluate back from the stack and remove
        the stack



Functional Programming:
    No mutation, no assignments at all
        his makes debugging easier, the state of things don't ever change
