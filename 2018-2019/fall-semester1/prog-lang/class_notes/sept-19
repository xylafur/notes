envionrments:
    like scope of a variable, this is not seen in the source code so much as in
    the runtime.

    we have to differentiate between what is written, which is static, and what
    is going on at runtime

    def f():
        x = 1
        return x

    The question is, where is this x living? In f as a local variable

    def g():
        g = f()
        print(x)
