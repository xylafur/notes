[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  function  [1mfread[22m() reads [4mnmemb[24m items of data, each [4msize[24m bytes long, from the stream pointed to by [4mstream[24m,
       storing them at the location given by [4mptr[24m.

       The function [1mfwrite[22m() writes [4mnmemb[24m items of data, each [4msize[24m bytes long, to the stream pointed to  by  [4mstream[24m,
       obtaining them from the location given by [4mptr[24m.

       For nonlocking counterparts, see [1munlocked_stdio[22m(3).

[1mRETURN VALUE[0m
       On  success,  [1mfread[22m() and [1mfwrite[22m() return the number of items read or written.  This number equals the number
       of bytes transferred only when [4msize[24m is 1.  If an error occurs, or the end of the file is reached, the  return
       value is a short item count (or zero).

       [1mfread[22m() does not distinguish between end-of-file and error, and callers must use [1mfeof[22m(3) and [1mferror[22m(3) to de‐
       termine which occurred.
