SPI: Serial Peripheral Interface

- SPI is Commonly used for communication with microcontrollers

- There are no 'packets' in SPI, bits are sent in a continuous stream

- Master / Slave Relationship
    - Devices using SPI have a master/ slave relationship

    - The slave takes instruction from the master

    - A master can control more than one slave

- Pins needed for SPI
    - MOSI (Master Output / Slave Input)
        - Line for the master to send data to the slave

    - MISO (Master Input/ Slave Output)
        - line by which the slave sends data to the master

    - SCLK (Clock)
        - Line for the clock signal

    - SS/CS (Slave Select / Chip Select)
        - Live for the master to select which slave to send data to

- Other general protocol info
    - 4 Wires
    - Max Speed of 10 Mbps
    - Synchronous (clock pin)
    - serial communication
    - only one master
    - theoretical unlimited number of slaves

- How it works
    - The clock determines data speed.
        - One bit of data is transfered each clock cycle

    - Clock signal can be modified using clock polarity and clock phase
        - together define when bits are output and when they are sampled
        - is set by the master to allow for data to be read on either the falling
          or rising edge


        - clock polarity
            - set by master to allow bits to be output and sampled on either
              rising or falling edge

        - clock phase
            - set for output and sampling to occur on either the first edge or
              the second edge, regardless of wether it is rising or falling

    - Slave Select
        - set to high in the non transmitting state

        - master selects which slave to talk to by putting th eline low

        - the master may have multiple slave slects or only one
            - this determines if they each get their own wire or if they are
              daisy-chained together

    - MOSI and MISO
        - data is ususally sent with the most significant bit first

        - data is sent one bit at a time

- Steps for Data Transmission
    - Master starts outputing the clock signal
    - master toggles the slave by putting the SS/CS pin low

    - the master sends data along the MOSI line
    - if a response is needed, te slave returns data one bit at a time to the
      master along the MISO line


- Advantages and Disadvantages of SPI
    - Advantages
        - no start and stop bits, data can be streamed without interruption
        - No complicated slave addressing like I2C
        - Higher Data transfer rate than I2C (almost twice as fast)
        - Seperate MOSI and MISO lines
            - data can be sent and recieved at the same time

    - Disadvantages
        - Uses 4 wires (I2C and UART only use 2)
        - No acknowledgement that the data has been successfully recieved
        - no form of error checking
        - ONly allows for a single master
