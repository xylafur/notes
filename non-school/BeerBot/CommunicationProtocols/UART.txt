UART: Universal Asynchronous Receiver / Transmitter

- What is it?
    - a physical circuit, not a communication protocol

- Intro
    - Two UART's communicate directly with each other.
    
    - Data flows from the TX pin of one guy to the RX pin of the other

    - Transmitted asynchronously
        - There are start and stop bits added to packets to account for this

    - When the recieving UART defects a start bit, it starts to read the
      incoming bits at a specific frequency (the baud rate)
        - the baud rate is expressed in terms of bits per second

        - both of the UARTs must use the same BAUD rate!!!

    - both sender and reciever must be configured to accept the same packet
      types


- Overview
    - Wire's used: 2
    - Masimum Speed: and speed up to 115200 baud, usually 9600

    - Asynchronous
    - Serial

    - Only one master and one slave

- How it works
    - data is transfered to the uart in parallel form.
    - After getting the data, the UART adds a start bit, a pairity bit and a
      stop bit
    - this data packet is then output serially, bit by bit at the TX pin

    - the recieving UART reads the data packet bit by bit at its Rx pin

    - The recieving UART then converts the data back into parallel form and
      removes the start bit, pairity and stop bit

    - The UART transfers the data packet in parallel to the data bus on the
      receiving end
