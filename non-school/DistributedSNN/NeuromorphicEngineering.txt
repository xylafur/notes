- Concept in which VLSI systems contain analog cirtuits to minic
  neuro-biological architectures present in the nervous system


- This could be implemented using a "Memristor"
    - a hypothetical passive two terminal electrical component
    - it relates electric charge and magnetic flux linkage

    - It hypothetically operates in this way:
        - The electrical resistance is not constant, but depends on the history
          of current that has previously flowed through the device

- Essentially it is the design of artificial neural systems
