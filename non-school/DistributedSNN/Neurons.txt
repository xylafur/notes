- Cell Membrane
    - Seperates the interior of cells from the exterior

- Membrane Potential
    - The difference between electric potential of interior and exterior of
      cells

    - Neurons generally have a relatively stable membrane potential
        - this is typically -70 to -80 mV

        - There are ion channels that are opened and closed which can change
          the potential
            - Ions flow through and this can change the potential

        - The change from stable Membrane potential can either lead to
          depolarization or hyperpolarization

            - in the case of depolarization, if it is significant enough, this
              can result in an action potential

- Ion channels are controlled by Membrane potential
    - this can lead to feedback loops that alow complex temporal dynamics to
      arise
        - this can include oscillations and regenerative events such as action
          potentials

- Action Potential
    - Membrane potential changes rapidly and significantly for a short time
      (order of milli seconds), and will often reverse its polarity


- Axon
    - Long slender projection of a neuron that conducts electrical impulses
      away from the nerve cell body

    - The Axon transmits information to other neurons

    - No neuron ever has more than one axon

    - Axons make contact with other cells at juntions called synapses
        - in some cases the Axon of a Neuron can form a synapse with the
          dendrites of the same neuron, forming a "Autapse"

    - The end branches of an Axon are called telodendria
        - it seems that an axon may have many such branches

- Axon Terminal
    - The terminations of telodendria
