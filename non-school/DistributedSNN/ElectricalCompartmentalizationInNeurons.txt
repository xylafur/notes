- It is thought that Dendrites require independent subunits to perform most of
  their computations

- Dendrites form an arborization, a tree like structure
    - this can be represented as an impedance based tree graph
        - the topology of this grap reveals subunits

- Cooperativity between synapses decreases slowly with increasing electrical
  seperation

- balanced inputs and shunting inhibition can modify the topology
    - this can increase the number or size of subunits in a context-dependent way

    - this dynamic recomparmentalization can enable branch specific learning of
      stimulus features

- Introduction
    - Electrical pulses in individual neurons transform into action potential
      output

    - this starts at the dendrite, where inputs are collected
        - this proceeds to the axion initial sement
            - AP are generated here before being transmitted to downstream
              neurons through the axon

    - The way in which the dendrites take in and combine input is called
      "Dendritic computation"

        - dendrites are cartmentalized into independent subunits, where these
          compartments can integrate inputs independently from other regions


        - these subunits allow for regenerative spikes of various chemicals

            - somehow this leads to a strengthening of the computational power
              of neurons

            - this enables local decodeing of bursts of inputs leading to the
              clustering of correlated synaptic inputs



    - Independent local chemical spikes allow neurons to behave in two-layer
      neural letworks
        - this should enable neurons to learn linearly nonseperable functinos
          and implement translational invariance

    - independent sub units are thought to dramatically increase memory
      capacity, allof for stable storage of feature associations and represent
      a powerful mechanism for coincedence detection and support the back
      propogation algorithm


    - though voltage decays sharply towards the branchpoints
        - remaining depolatization can cause cooperative dynamics

        - this can limit the number of comparments that coexist on dendritic
          trees


    - The defree of cooperativity between synapses can be summarized by a
      single measurable number
        - this is termed the impeadance-based independence index

    - Compartmentalization is not a static concept, but can be regulated
      dynamically
        - balanced inputs or shunting inhibition can modify the topology
