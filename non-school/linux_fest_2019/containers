- What is a coontainer?
    - sandbox for a process

    
- Chroot
    - change root directory
        - not really though, changes apparent root directory

- whitepaper

- Whats a container made of?
    - Namespaces
        - limits your ability to see things on the filesystem
            - you can have a root user in a chroot that is nobody on the main
              system

        - she says there are 6 linux namespaces
            - user, ipc, uts, mount, pid, network

            - these containers allow you to have isolated for each of these
              guys
                - mount namespace gives you ability to access / use mounts


        - namespaces are stored in /var/run

- why are containers used?
    - just because they're way easier to use and create than some unix jail or
      chroot env

- lxc
    - linux containers

    - super charged chroot env,
        - allows you to isolate an entire os distro

    - 2 types of containers
        - os containers
            - more attack vectors than an app container because you have all of
              the possible attack vectors of the os

        - application containers
            - only contains the binaries, libraries, etc
            - only the things neede to run ur app

    - allows you to send kernel system calls down to the containers
        - this is why you are able to run linux containers on a linux systems 
            - they share the same system calls, and they send the system calls
              down to the container


- docker
    - provides an env the gives you everything you need to run, and only that

    - lxc is closer to the hardware, its not generic
        - docker will run on any system, it is hardware independent
        - lxc gives you control over which bus to use, which region of ram to
          use, etc

    - she adocates using both lxc and docker
        - lxc for development, docker for deployment


    - docker hub
        - share images
