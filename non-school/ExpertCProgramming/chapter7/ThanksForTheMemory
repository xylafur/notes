- Virtual Memory
    - Cache
        - depending on the architecture, either physical or virtual addresses
          might be cached
            - if virtual addresses are cached then they must be flushed out when a
              context switch happens

        - remember that there the cache hit/miss thing!
            - we search cache first, if we find it we use it, if we don't we
              have to go look into memory which takes longer

        - types of cache writes
            - write-through
                - initiates a write to main memory at the same time it writes
                  to cache

            - write-back
                - writes only to cache on the first instance, the data is
                  transfered to main memory when the cache line is about to be
                  written again and a save hasn't taken place

                - also transfered to memory on a context switch

            - in both cases we don't wait for the write to memory, we write to
              cache and then move on with our lives

        - there may be a seperate cache for the I/O bus if the processor uses
          memory-mapped I/O
            - there is often caches for both instructions and data


    - Caching
        - UNIX (probably linux too), Inodes are cahced in memory
            - this means that if you power off the system without flushing
              cache it can result in corruptions!

            - the `sync` command flushes this cache to disk
