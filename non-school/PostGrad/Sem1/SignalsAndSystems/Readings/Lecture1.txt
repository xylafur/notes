Note on complex Numbers
    e^(j * :theta:) = cos(:theta:) + j * sin(:theta:)

    cos(:theta:) = 1/2 * (e^(j * :theta:) + e^(-j * :theta:))
    sin(:theta:) = 1/2 * (e^(j * :theta:) - e^(-j * :theta:))

1.0 Introduction

1.1 Continuous and Discrete Time Signals
    1.1.1 Examples and Mathematical Representation
        - Signals are represented mathematically as functions of one or more independent variables

        - For continuous time signals
            - we use the independent variable t
            - we use circular parenthesis

        - For discrete time signals
            - we use independent variable n
            - we use square brackets


        - Computers process discrete time signals
            - so we must sample continuous time signals before giving them to a computer

    1.1.2 Signal Energy and Power
        - Power is qual to vi, so
            p(t) = v(t)*i(t) = (1/R) v(t)^2

        - Then the total energy expended over a time interval would be the integral with respsect to
          time
            integral(p(t), t1, t2) = integral((1/R) v(t)^2, t1, t2)

        - We can take the average of this as well
            1/(t2-t1) * integral(p(t), t1, t2) = 1/(t2-t1) * integral((1/R) v(t)^2, t1, t2)

        - We use the same notion of power for both continous and discrete signals
            - but sometimes we deal with complex number so we take the magnitude

            - Continuous
                integral(|x(t)|^2, t1, t2)

            - Discrete
                sum(|x[n]|^2, n=n1, n2)

        - If we analyze energy functions over all of time, from -inf to +inf, we can describe 3 classes
          of signals    
            1. Finite total Energy
                E -> infinity < infinity

                - the signal must have zero average power

            2. Finite Average Power
                - infinite energy, because integrating a constant over an infinite period of time is
                  inf

                P -> inf > 0

            3. Neither Power or Energy as they approach inf are finite
                - `x(t) = t` is an example

1.6 Basic System Properties
    1.6.5 Time Invariance
        - a system is time invariant if the behavior and characteristics of the system are fixed
          over time

        - A system is time invariant if a time shift in the input signal results in an identical
          time shift in the output signal

            - if `y(t) = x(t)` then `y(t - to) = x(t - to)`

    1.6.6 Linearity
        - a system that possesses superposition
            - if an input consists of the weighted sum of several signals, then the output is the
              superposition

        - A system is linear if for y1(t) = x1(t), y2(t) = x2(t)
            
            1. x1(t) + x2(t) = y1(t) + y2(t)
                - this is the additive property
            2. a * x1(t) = a * y1(t)
                - this is the scaling (homogeneity) property
                - here a is any complex constant


        - Superposition Property
            x[n] = sum(a_k * x_k[n]) = a1 * x1[n] + a2 * x2[n] + ...
            y[n] = sum(a_k * y_k[n]) = a1 * y1[n] + a2 * y2[n] + ...

2.0 Introduction
    - Linear Time Invariant Systems
        - many physical processes can be modelted as LTI systems

        - if the signal be represented as the superposition of many other signals, we are ina good
          place


    - Very general systems can be represented as a linear combinations of delayed impulses

2.1 Discrete time LTI systems: The Convolution Sum
    2.1.1 The representation of discrete time sinals in terms of impuleses
        - think of a discrete time signal as a sequence of individual impulses

        - We can break some discrete signal up into each of the different integer input output
          pairs
            - I think this is what an impulse is.
            - So we have a seperate graph for x[0], x[1], x[2] etc..
            - all of the other points are just 0

        - We can write the discrete equation as the sum of all the impulses

        - we have an equation :delta:[n] that is equal to 1 if the input is 0.
            - we pass in the shifted n value as the input to this equation

    2.1.2 The discrete time unit impulse reponse and the convlution sum representaion of LTI
          systems
