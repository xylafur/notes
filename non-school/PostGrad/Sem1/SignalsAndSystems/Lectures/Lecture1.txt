- Signals are functions of one or more variables that carry information
    - a speech signal is a good exaple
        - such as the air pressure as a function of time

- Systems are typically used to process signals


- Types of Signals
    - One dimensional Signal
        - only one independent variable

    - Two dimensional Signal


    - Signals have dimensionality and then can be continuous or not on top of that


    - Continuous Time Signals
        - A signal where the independent variable is continuous


    - Discrete Time Signals (can also be one dimensional or multidimensional)
        - The signal is a function of some integer variable
        - so it only takes on values at integer values of the independent variable
        - economic time series / stock market analysis is a good example

        - written using rectangluar brackets x[n, m]

        - discrete time signals are important because we have modern tech where we convert
          continuous signals into discrete signals that we operate on


    - the independent variable is generally refered to as a time variable (even if its not actually
      a time variable)


- Images
    - images as signals have brightness as a function of horizontal and veritical independent
      variables



- Systems
    - has input and outputs
    - depending on if the input is continuous or discrete, the system is either continuous or
      discrete
        - the output matches whatever the input is


    - types of systems
        - linear
        - non linear

        - time inveriant
        - time varying

        - Our focus for the course will be "Linear Time Inveriant Systems"


- Interconnection of Systems
    - Series (Cascade) connections
    - Parallel
    - Feedback connections
        - covered in depth towards the end of the course
        - can be used to stabalize an unstable system


- Domains for Analysis and Representation
    - Time Domain
        - If you consider a note, the time domain is the sound pressure of the note
          would change as a function of time

    - Frequency Domain
        - Representation for signals as a means for anaylsis by systems

        - Fourier Transform, Laplace Transform and Z-Transform

        - IF you consider a note, this is the frequency break down of the note
