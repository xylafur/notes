Terms:
    envelope:  Kinda like an asymptote.  The bounds for an expanding or decaying signal

- Continuous time Sinosoidal signal
    x(t) = A*cos(wo*t + phi)
        A  : Amplitide
        wo : frequency
        phi: Phase

    - Important properties
        - refered to as periodic: The signal repeats itself after a particular amount of time
            x(t) = x(t + n*T)

            A*cos[wo * t + phi] = A * cos [wo * t + wo * T + phi]

            - The period then must be: 2 * phi / wo


    - Useful properties:
        - A time shift is the same as a phase change

            A * cos [wo * (t + to)] = A * cos [wo * t + wo * to]

        - Even:
            - a signal is symetric across the origin
            - a sinosoidal cosine signal with no phase is an example

            x(t) = x(-t)

        - Odd:
            - When you flip the signal across the origin, you also multiply it by a negative sign


    - Discrete time sinusoidal signal
        x[n] = A * cos( omega * n + phi )
            - omega is the frequency

        - Relationship between a time shift and a phase change
            - For discrete time if you do a time shift that results in a phase change
            - But if you do a phase change, its not always equivalent to some time shift

            - In the time shift -> phase change direction it is the same as continuous
                even: x[n] = x[-n]
                odd : x[n] = -x[-n]

            - phase change -> time shift
                - This doesn't always work because the relationship between time shift and phase
                  change must be an integer

                x[n] = A * cos( omega * n  +  omega * n_o)

                omega * n_o = phi.  So if phi / omega is not an integer, then this will not work!
                    - this is because we are in discrete time



    - Another distinction between continuous and discrete time
        - Continuous time signals are always periodic but discrete time signals aren't always

        - In continuous time:
            - all sinusoidal signals are periodic

            - remember that a signal is periodic if N * omega = 2 * pi * m

            A * cos(w_o * n  + phi) is always periodic!

        - For discrete time
            - N has to be some integer multiple of 2 * pi / omega!!
            
            - so `31 = 2 * pi / omega` would be okay as would `2 * pi / omegag = 31 / 4`

            A * cos(omega * n + phi) is periodic only if omega = 2 * pi * m / N



- Real and Complex Exponentials
    - For exponential
        - a time shift results in a scale change

    - Real Continous Time Exponential
        x(t) = C * e ^ (at)

            - C and a are real numbers

    - Real Discrete Time Exponential
        x[n] = C * e ^ (beta * n) = C * alpha ^ n

            - alpha = e^beta, this is often how these are expressed

        - if alpha is positive
            - The graph will be either completley positive or completley negative

        - if alpha is negative
            - the graph will alternate between positive and negative while decaying or expanding

        
    - Continuos Time Complex exponential
        x(t) = C * e ^ (at)

            - C and a are complex numbers
            - we write C in polar form
            - we write a in rectangular form

            x(t) = |C| * e ^ (j*theta) * e ^ ( (r + j * w_o) * t)

                 = |C| * e ^ (r * t) * e ^ (j * (w_o * t + theta))



    - Discrete Time Complex Exponentials
        - x[n] =  C * alpha ^ n
            - C and alpha are compelx numbers

        - the signal will alternate between positive and negative

        - if |a| > 1 then the overall function is increasing
        - if |a| < 1 then the function is decreasing

        - in both cases they are bounded by an envelope


- Remember that when you use Euler's method to expand a complex number you end up with the cosine
  and sine functions where the sin has a jhat in front of it
