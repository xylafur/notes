- LTI systems are much better for analysis

- If we know the Impulse Response h(t) ) for a linear system
    - we can determine the output based on the input

    - this is done through convolution

    y(t) = x9t) * h(t)
                ^
                |
                This asterick is a special operator called convolution

    - We only have to know this above function and the input to get the output


  
- Transfer function H(s)
    - Another way to characterize the system

    - this is used in conjunction with the Laplace Transform

    - Laplace transforms allow for easier convolution

    Y(s) = X(s)H(s)

- Frequency response H(j omega)

    - the omega shows that we are in the frequency domain

    - We use a Fourier Transform

    Y(j omega) = X(j omega)H(j omega)
    

- Knowing the convolution is essential to doing these though!
