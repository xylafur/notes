8
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,190
PROFESSOR: In this lecture we
begin a discussion of the

9
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,860
topic of modulation, which is,
among other things, a very

10
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:06,160
important topic in
practical terms.

11
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,400
For example, it forms the
cornerstone for many

12
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,280
communication systems.

13
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,290
And also, as we'll see as these
lectures go along, a

14
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,380
particular form of modulation
referred to as pulse amplitude

15
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:24,350
modulation, and eventually
impulse modulation or impulse

16
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:28,930
train modulation, forms a very
important bridge between

17
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:33,670
continuous time signals and
discrete time signals.

18
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:37,590
Now in general terms what
we mean when we refer to

19
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:43,280
modulation is the notion of
using one signal to vary a

20
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,110
parameter of another signal.

21
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:51,510
For example, a sinusoidal signal
has three parameters,

22
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:54,520
amplitude, frequency,
and phase.

23
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:59,920
And we could think, for example,
of using one signal

24
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,080
to vary, let's say,
the amplitude of

25
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,730
a sinusoidal signal.

26
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:08,259
And what that leads to is a
notion, which we'll develop in

27
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:12,300
some detail, referred to
as sinusoidal amplitude

28
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,780
modulation, and would correspond
to a sinusoidal

29
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:22,670
signal, referred to as the
carrier, and it's amplitude

30
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:27,700
being varied on the basis
of another signal.

31
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,800
Now alternatively we could think
of varying either the

32
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,790
frequency or the phase of a
sinusoidal signal, again with

33
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,200
another signal.

34
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,850
And what that leads to is
another very important notion,

35
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:45,480
which is referred to sinusoidal
frequency

36
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,850
modulation, where essentially
it's the frequency of a

37
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:54,850
sinusoid that's changing
depending on the signal that's

38
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:59,460
we're using to modulate
the sinusoid.

39
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:03,200
Now sinusoidal amplitude,
frequency, and phase

40
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,950
modulation are extremely
important topics and ideas in

41
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,570
the context of communication
systems.

42
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,800
One of the reasons is that if
you want to transmit a signal,

43
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,880
let's say for example a voice
signal, the voice signal that

44
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,980
you're listening to now.

45
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,320
If you try to transmit that over
long distances, because

46
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,740
of the frequencies involved
the medium that you use to

47
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:31,530
transmit it won't carry
it long distances.

48
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:35,030
The idea then is to essentially
take that signal,

49
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:38,760
like a voice signal, use
it to modulate a much

50
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,980
higher-frequency signal,
and then transmit that

51
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,510
higher-frequency signal over a
medium that essentially can

52
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:49,060
support long-distance
transmission at those

53
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,420
frequencies.

54
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,240
Then at the other end of course,
the voice information,

55
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,480
or whatever else the information
is, is taken off.

56
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,370
Now also, a notion that that
leads to, and we'll be

57
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:06,140
developing in some detail,
is the idea that you can

58
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:11,940
simultaneously transmit more
than one signal by in essence

59
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:16,000
taking several voice signals or
other signals, using them

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,279
to modulate either the frequency
or amplitude of

61
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:23,750
sinusoidal signals at different
frequencies, adding

62
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,940
all those together--

63
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,330
that's a process called
multiplexing--

64
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:31,040
and then at the other end of
the transmission system,

65
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,570
taking those sinusoidal
signals apart.

66
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:37,610
And then extracting the
envelope or frequency

67
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:41,910
modulation information to get
back to the voice signal or

68
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,630
other information-carrying
signal.

69
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:50,420
So that's one of the very
important ways in which

70
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:54,670
sinusoidal modulation is used
in communication systems.

71
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:59,100
And what we'll see, in
particular as we go through

72
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:04,980
today's lecture, is that
sinusoidal amplitude

73
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:10,630
modulation, follows in a fairly
straightforward way

74
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:14,250
from the properties of the
Fourier transform that we've

75
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,920
developed in some of the
earlier lectures.

76
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:22,520
So our focus in today's lecture
will be on sinusoidal

77
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,580
amplitude modulation
in continuous time.

78
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,740
In the next lecture we'll
consider the same set of

79
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,950
notions related to discrete
time, and also a concept

80
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:36,040
referred to as pulse amplitude
modulation.

81
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,690
And all of these follow, in a
very straightforward way, from

82
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:43,470
the modulation property for
the Fourier transform.

83
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:47,460
Issues of frequency and phase
modulation are a little more

84
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,760
difficult to analyze.

85
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,570
But many of the techniques that
we've developed in the

86
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:57,190
previous lectures also provide
important insights into

87
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,930
frequency and phase
modulation.

88
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:04,060
And some of this is developed
in more detail in the book.

89
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:09,050
So what I'd like to do is focus,
for now, on the concept

90
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:12,520
of amplitude modulation.

91
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:18,270
And as I indicated, there are
several kinds of carrier

92
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:22,010
signals on which the
modulation can be

93
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,460
superimposed.

94
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:27,230
The basic structure for an
amplitude modulation system is

95
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:30,870
one in which there is the
modulating signal, let's say

96
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:34,400
for example, voice, and a
carrier signal-- what's

97
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,560
referred to as the carrier.

98
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,550
And then of course the resulting
output is the

99
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,640
modulated output.

100
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:45,890
Now to analyze this, since we
have multiplication in the

101
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:49,350
time domain, we know from the
property of the Fourier

102
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,920
transform that we've developed
previously--

103
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,750
the modulation property--

104
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,900
that multiplication in the time
domain corresponds to

105
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,550
convolution in the
frequency domain.

106
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:04,890
And it's this basic property
or equation that lets us

107
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:09,420
analyze, in some detail in fact,
the notions of amplitude

108
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,590
modulation.

109
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:15,240
As we go through this lecture
and the next lecture, we'll be

110
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,920
talking, as I indicated, about
several different types of

111
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,700
carrier signals.

112
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,910
One is what's referred
to as pulse carriers.

113
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:28,390
And that leads to, among other
things, the concept of pulse

114
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,220
amplitude modulation.

115
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:34,050
That will be deferred until
the next lecture.

116
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:39,720
In today's lecture what I'll
focus on is first, the case of

117
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,240
a complex exponential carrier,
second, the case

118
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,210
of sinusoidal carrier.

119
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:48,490
And in fact the complex
exponential carrier and

120
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:51,770
sinusoidal carrier are obviously
very closely

121
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:56,710
related, since the complex
exponential carrier is, in

122
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:00,350
effect, two sinusoidal
carriers.

123
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:04,900
One for the real part and one
for the imaginary part.

124
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,700
So let's first begin the
discussion of amplitude

125
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:12,840
modulation by considering a
complex exponential carrier,

126
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,900
and then moving on to
a discussion of

127
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,490
a sinusoidal carrier.

128
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:26,930
So the issue then is that we
have a signal, x of t.

129
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,060
It's multiplied by a carrier.

130
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,860
And the carrier that we're
considering is a carrier

131
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:39,919
signal, c of t, of the form
e to the j omega c t

132
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,030
plus theta sub c.

133
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:45,430
That's the form of our
carrier signal.

134
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:52,110
And what we can first analyze
is what the resulting signal

135
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:55,870
or spectrum is at the output
of the modulator.

136
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:59,870
Well, we can do that by
concentrating on the

137
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,650
modulation property.

138
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:06,820
And let's consider, just as a
general form for a spectrum,

139
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:14,220
what I've indicated here for the
Fourier transform of the

140
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,260
input signal or modulating
signal, X of omega.

141
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:22,650
And so this is intended
to represent the

142
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:25,760
spectrum of x of t.

143
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,140
And then the carrier signal,
since it's a single complex

144
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:35,340
exponential, has a Fourier
transform which is an impulse

145
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,300
in the frequency domain.

146
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:42,450
And the amplitude of the impulse
is 2 pi e to the j

147
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:46,310
theta sub c, where we notice
that the complex amplitude

148
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:50,110
incorporates the phase
information.

149
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:54,690
So now if we multiply in the
time domain, we convolve in

150
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:55,920
the frequency domain.

151
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,850
And as you know, convolving a
signal with an impulse just

152
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,380
shifts that signal to the
location of the impulse.

153
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:07,400
And so as a consequence of
taking care of various

154
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:13,250
factors, what we end up with is
a spectrum that is centered

155
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:18,660
at the carrier frequency
omega sub c.

156
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:25,330
So what this says is that if we
have a signal, x of t, and

157
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:31,040
we use it to modulate a complex
exponential carrier in

158
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,570
the frequency domain, what we've
simply done is to take

159
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:39,760
the original spectrum and
shift it in frequency.

160
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,340
So that what was originally at
zero frequency is now centered

161
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,590
around the carrier frequency.

162
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,160
We've now modulated, in effect,
to a higher frequency.

163
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,180
Things are happening in a
higher-frequency band.

164
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:57,200
And the next question is, how do
we demodulate, or in other

165
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,540
words, how do we get the
original signal back?

166
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,210
Of course one way that we
can think of doing it,

167
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:09,790
particularly in the context of
this specific carrier, if we

168
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:14,660
look back at the top equation we
have, as the result of the

169
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:19,470
modulation, x of t times c of
t, where c of t is this.

170
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:24,370
And we could consider, for
example, just simply dividing

171
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:26,530
the modulator output by this.

172
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:29,790
Or equivalently, taking the
modulated output and

173
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:37,170
multiplying by e to the minus
j omega c t plus theta c.

174
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:40,790
Let's track that through in
terms of the spectra.

175
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:46,020
We have, again, the spectrum
of the output of the

176
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:49,130
modulator, which is the original
spectrum shifted up

177
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:51,530
to the carrier frequency.

178
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:58,130
We have, below that, the
spectrum of e to the minus j

179
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:01,050
omega c t plus theta c.

180
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:06,440
And if we now convolve this
with this, that results in

181
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,300
simply shifting this spectrum--
except for an issue

182
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,750
of a scale factor--

183
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:14,430
shifting this spectrum back
down to the origin.

184
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:17,560
So convolving these two
together, the spectrum that we

185
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,740
end up with is that.

186
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:25,370
So we can track this through
in the frequency domain.

187
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,900
In the frequency domain it says
shift the spectrum up.

188
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:32,430
When you want to demodulate,
shift the spectrum back down.

189
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:35,780
And alternatively, we can look
at it algebraically in the

190
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,320
time domain.

191
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,010
And what it says is, if you
multiply by e to the plus j

192
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:44,150
omega c t, then when you want to
get back, multiply by e to

193
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,920
the minus j omega c t.

194
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:51,280
Now one question that you could
conceivably be asking

195
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,730
is, if we're talking about
practical systems and not

196
00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:01,890
simply mathematics, does it make
sense in the real world

197
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:06,530
to consider using a complex
exponential carrier?

198
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:11,300
And the answer to that,
in fact, is yes.

199
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:16,460
That very often in practical
systems one considers using a

200
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:20,640
carrier which in fact is
a complex exponential.

201
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,890
Well, a complex exponential
is complex.

202
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:25,440
There's a square root of
minus one in there.

203
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,590
And you could ask well,
how do we get a square

204
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,170
root of minus one?

205
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,970
And the answer is
fairly simple.

206
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:37,030
Let's look again at the
modulator, which we have here.

207
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:40,980
And in effect, what that says
is we want to multiply a

208
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:45,840
real-valued signal by e to the
j omega c t plus theta c.

209
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:51,030
Now, we can equivalently use
Euler's relationship to break

210
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:54,650
this down into a cosine
and sine term.

211
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:57,660
And so what that means in terms
of an implementation,

212
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:07,140
equivalently, is modulating x
of t onto a cosine carrier.

213
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:10,850
And that then gives
us the real part

214
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,830
of the complex output.

215
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:17,780
And modulating it onto a
sinusoidal carrier--

216
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:20,340
these two being 90 degrees
out of phase--

217
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:23,500
and that gives us the
imaginary part.

218
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,010
And so in effect, this is
the complex signal.

219
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:30,440
If we just simply think of
hanging a tag on here that

220
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,500
says square root of minus 1,
or j, and we appropriately

221
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,210
combine complex signals
following the rules of complex

222
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,110
arithmetic.

223
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:42,020
And indeed, that's exactly the
way things are done in the

224
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,010
real world.

225
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:48,660
A complex signal is simply a
set of two real signals.

226
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:54,220
And of course, if we look at the
spectra involved, we have

227
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,690
here the real part and
the imaginary part

228
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:59,990
of the complex output.

229
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:05,330
If we again refer back to the
original spectrum, X of omega,

230
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:10,580
and the modulated spectrum which
I show down here, the

231
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:16,030
original spectrum shifted up
to the carrier frequency.

232
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:20,610
In effect we're building
this out of two lines.

233
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:25,870
One line representing the
real part of that.

234
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:29,610
And the real part in the time
domain corresponds to the even

235
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:31,290
part in the frequency domain.

236
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:37,680
And so with the output of the
cosine modulator, we have a

237
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,750
spectrum that looks like this.

238
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:47,120
And the output along the
imaginary branch has a

239
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,310
spectrum that looks like this.

240
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:54,690
Recall in the top branch that
this, for positive frequencies

241
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:57,210
was positive, and was
positive here.

242
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:00,260
And so in effect when you add
them, this portion of the

243
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,490
spectrum will cancel out.

244
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:10,360
So in effect, what we're doing
is building the complex signal

245
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,850
out of two real signals.

246
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:16,710
Or we're building the spectrum
of the complex signal out of

247
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:20,745
separate lines that represent
the even and the odd parts.

248
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:29,640
Now, there are lots of
applications of amplitude

249
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,910
modulation.

250
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:33,390
And we'll be seeing a number of
these as we go through the

251
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,420
discussion.

252
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:39,660
What I'd like to do is just
indicate briefly one now,

253
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:44,560
which is an application that in
fact surfaces fairly often

254
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:49,540
in the context of a complex
exponential carrier.

255
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:58,440
And that is the notion of using
modulation to permit the

256
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:03,550
application of a very well
designed and implemented

257
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:08,240
low-pass filter to be used as
a band-pass filter and in

258
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,520
fact, as a set of band-pass
filters.

259
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,680
And here's the idea.

260
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:18,230
The idea is if we have
a fixed filter--

261
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,990
let's say we have a signal.

262
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:24,359
And we want to think of a
filter, which we want to move

263
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:28,640
along the signal, one way to
do it is to somehow have

264
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,950
filters that move along
the signal.

265
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:34,870
The other possibility is to keep
the filter fixed and let

266
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:39,250
the signal move in frequency
in front of the filter.

267
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,540
Let me be a little
more specific.

268
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:47,860
Suppose that we have
a signal, x of t.

269
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:52,500
And we modulate it with a
complex exponential carrier

270
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,490
with a carrier frequency,
omega c.

271
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:01,020
And the output of that is then
processed with a low-pass

272
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:06,910
filter and then we demodulate
the result.

273
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:12,770
Then what we've done is to take
the spectrum of the input

274
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:18,440
signal, shift it, pull out
what is now around low

275
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,200
frequencies, and then shift that
part of the spectrum back

276
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,190
to where it belongs.

277
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:28,900
So if we look at that in terms
of actually tracking through

278
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:34,180
the spectra, we would have
initially a spectrum for the

279
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:40,050
original signal, which I show
at the top as X of omega.

280
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:44,750
After modulating or shifting
that spectrum up to a center

281
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:49,530
frequency of omega c, we then
have what I indicate here.

282
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:53,490
And the dotted line corresponds
to the pass band

283
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:55,430
of the low-pass filter.

284
00:18:55,430 --> 00:19:00,590
Well, the result of low-pass
filtering rejects all the

285
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:04,970
spectrum except the part
around low frequencies.

286
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:10,260
And the next step is then
to demodulate this.

287
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:14,640
And so in effect, demodulating
will shift this spectrum back

288
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,490
to where it originally
came from.

289
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:22,710
And so that result will be
what I show in the final

290
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:25,680
result, which is here.

291
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:31,140
And what we can see is that
this is equivalent.

292
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:36,170
If we can look back at the top
spectrum, this is equivalent

293
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:41,070
to having extracted, with a
band-pass filter, a section

294
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:43,860
out of this part of
the spectrum.

295
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:47,840
So in terms of tracking through
the spectrum and

296
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:54,240
looking at the equivalent
filtering operation, then what

297
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:00,470
we accomplished was to pull out
this part of the spectrum

298
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:03,950
using a low-pass filter
and modulation.

299
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:07,770
But equivalently what we
implemented was a band-pass

300
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:10,750
filter as I indicated here.

301
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:14,030
Now of course, a signal with
this spectrum, since the

302
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:17,030
spectrum is not conjugate
symmetric, we know that this

303
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:20,620
signal does not correspond
to a real-valued signal.

304
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:24,400
Equivalently this filter doesn't
correspond to a filter

305
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,990
whose impulse response
is real.

306
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:32,140
If we add another step to this,
which is to take the

307
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:36,290
real part of the output, then by
taking the real part of the

308
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:40,550
output we would be taking the
even part of the spectrum

309
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:43,080
associated with that
complex signal.

310
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:47,860
And the equivalent filter that
we would end up with then is

311
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:52,250
the filter that I indicate
at the bottom, which is a

312
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,950
band-pass filter.

313
00:20:54,950 --> 00:21:00,750
Now just to reiterate a point
that I made earlier.

314
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,860
A question, of course, is why
would you go to this trouble?

315
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,520
Why not just build a
band-pass filter?

316
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:13,300
And one of the reasons is that
it's often much easier to

317
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:17,920
build a fixed filter, a filter
with a fixed-center frequency,

318
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,680
for example a low-pass filter,
than it is to build a filter

319
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,030
that has variable components
in it so that when you vary

320
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:28,920
them the filter's center
frequency shifts around.

321
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,880
Now, if you want to look at
the energy in a signal in

322
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,450
different frequency bands, then
you'd like to look at it

323
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:37,660
through different filters.

324
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:41,390
And so the idea here, which is
really the basis for many

325
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:45,810
spectrum analyzers, is to build
a really good quality

326
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:50,320
low-pass filter and then use
modulation, which is often

327
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,260
easier to implement.

328
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:56,470
Use modulation to shift the
signal essentially in front of

329
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,720
the filter.

330
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:05,600
So we've worked our way through
modulation with a

331
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,350
complex exponential carrier.

332
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:13,090
And what we saw, among other
things with a complex

333
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:17,340
exponential carrier,
is that what it

334
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:23,260
corresponds to is two branches.

335
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:28,130
One being modulation with
a cosine, and the other,

336
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:29,570
modulation with a sine.

337
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:34,340
And so in the real world, or
in a practical system,

338
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:37,610
modulation of the complex
exponential carrier really

339
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:41,930
would be accomplished with
modulation with a sinusoidal

340
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:47,330
carrier, and in particular with
sinusoidal carriers that

341
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:50,660
are in quadrature, as it's
referred to, or equivalently

342
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:54,170
90 degrees out of phase.

343
00:22:54,170 --> 00:23:00,750
Well, in fact sinusoidal
modulation, in other words,

344
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:04,970
modulation using only a
sinusoidal carrier, very often

345
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:10,020
is used in its own right not
only for generating a complex

346
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:17,060
exponential carrier, but
as a carrier by itself.

347
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:21,370
Let's look at what the
consequences of modulation

348
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:23,500
with a sinusoidal carrier are.

349
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,830
And in particular work through,
again, what the

350
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:32,410
spectra are and how we get the
original signal back again.

351
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:39,150
So we are talking about a
carrier signal which is simply

352
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:42,920
a sinusoidal signal
with some phase.

353
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:48,650
And of course we can write that
as the sum of two complex

354
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:51,460
exponential signals.

355
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:56,500
And so now, when we apply the
modulation property we have

356
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:01,190
the original spectrum, which
I show here, X of omega.

357
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:05,340
And that's convolved with the
spectrum of the carrier.

358
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,310
And the spectrum of the
carrier, in this

359
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:10,520
case, is two impulses.

360
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:16,270
One at plus omega c, and
one at minus omega c.

361
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:19,510
And the amplitudes of these
incorporate the phase.

362
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:25,620
And later on in the lecture,
and in subsequent lectures,

363
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:30,500
I'll have a tendency to drop the
theta sub c, just to keep

364
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,820
the notation and algebra a
little cleaner, but for now

365
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,340
I've incorporated it.

366
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:41,040
And so now when we apply the
modulation property, what we

367
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:46,270
will do is convolve this
spectrum with this spectrum,

368
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:50,060
and the result is that the
spectrum of the original

369
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:55,690
signal gets replicated at
both omega sub c and at

370
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,460
minus omega sub c.

371
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:00,800
And the resulting spectrum at
the output of the modulator,

372
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,540
then, is the spectrum
that I show here.

373
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,930
Now the question,
of course, is--

374
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:12,990
so now what's happened is that
with a sinusoidal carrier,

375
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:16,710
we've moved the spectrum
to both plus omega c

376
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:18,870
and minus omega c.

377
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:22,570
And now if we want to get the
original signal back again,

378
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:26,480
what we would like to do somehow
is move that spectrum

379
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,500
back down to the origin.

380
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,050
Now in the case of a complex
exponential,

381
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:33,020
that was easy to do.

382
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,910
We'd shifted one up, we'd
just shift it back down.

383
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:41,320
Let's see what happens if we
attempt to demodulate by again

384
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:45,960
multiplying by the same
sinusoidal carrier.

385
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:55,690
So let's examine what happens
if we now take our modulated

386
00:25:55,690 --> 00:26:03,600
signal and, again, modulate it
onto the same sinusoidal

387
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,010
carrier to generate
the output w of t.

388
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:14,340
If we look at the spectra, we
have the modulated spectrum

389
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,940
which we had initially.

390
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:21,300
And we now want to convolve
that, again, with the spectrum

391
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,470
of the carrier signal.

392
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:26,840
The spectrum of the carrier
signal, I indicate here.

393
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:30,350
And if you track through the
convolution, which is fairly

394
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:34,870
straightforward, then what
happens as you convolve this

395
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:43,270
with this is you end up with a
composite spectrum, which is

396
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:48,730
what I've indicated on the
bottom curve, and has the

397
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:52,990
spectrum of the original signal,
x of t, replicated in

398
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:54,220
three places.

399
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:58,920
One is at minus 2 omega sub c.

400
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,960
One is around the origin.

401
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,980
And one is shifted up to twice
the carrier frequency.

402
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:08,150
Well it's this piece
that we want.

403
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:12,480
If we could eliminate everything
else and keep this,

404
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:18,360
then that would correspond to
the spectrum of the original

405
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,020
signal, x of t.

406
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,410
How do we do that?

407
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:26,870
Well, we know how to eliminate
part of the spectrum and keep

408
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:27,990
another part of the spectrum.

409
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:29,320
That's called filtering.

410
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:35,440
So what we would do is put the
result of this through a

411
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,035
low-pass filter.

412
00:27:37,035 --> 00:27:39,480
The low-pass filter route would
retain the part of the

413
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:44,720
spectrum around DC and eliminate
the remaining part

414
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,330
of the spectrum.

415
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:49,090
So we would keep this part and
eliminate the part of the

416
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:51,410
spectrum that we
have over here.

417
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:54,490
And let me just draw your
attention to the fact that,

418
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:59,190
because of the way the algebra
works out, the amplitude of

419
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:01,950
this replication of the spectrum
is half what the

420
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:04,320
original spectrum was.

421
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:09,660
And that means that ideally, to
keep scale factors correct,

422
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:14,890
we would choose the amplitude of
this to be 2, to scale this

423
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:18,150
back up to 1.

424
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:23,140
So what we have is the modulator
and demodulator.

425
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:30,010
And just to summarize, for the
case of a sinusoidal carrier

426
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:33,860
as opposed to a complex
exponential carrier, the

427
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:39,060
modulator is just as it is in
the complex exponential case.

428
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:44,560
It's multiplication with the
sinusoidal carrier, with

429
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,190
frequency, omega c, and
phase, theta sub c.

430
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:57,740
In the demodulator we would
take the modulated signal,

431
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:00,820
modulate it again with the
same carrier signal--

432
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:03,740
and as we'll see later, it's
important to keep the same

433
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:06,100
phase relationship.

434
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:11,870
This result is not yet quite
the demodulated signal.

435
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:17,090
We need to process that with a
low-pass filter that extracts

436
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:21,550
the part of the spectrum around
DC and throws away the

437
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:24,560
upper part of the spectrum that
gets generated in the

438
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,770
second modulation process.

439
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:32,380
And the resulting output is the
original signal, x of t.

440
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,490
What we've done then is
we've taken x of t.

441
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:41,120
We've modulated it
onto a carrier.

442
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,380
And then we've taken that
modulated signal and we've

443
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,360
figured out how to
get back x of t.

444
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,545
And of course one could ask,
well, if you start with x of t

445
00:29:49,545 --> 00:29:52,470
and you want to get x of t back
again, why bother going

446
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,160
through all that?

447
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,980
Why not just use x of t at the
beginning and at the end?

448
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:59,300
And obviously there are
lots of reasons

449
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,880
as I indicated before.

450
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:06,060
And just to reiterate
what they are.

451
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:10,540
The notion, often, is that what
you'd like to do is shift

452
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:14,330
the signal into a different
frequency band for

453
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:19,370
transmission over some medium
that is more matched to that

454
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:22,090
frequency band than the
frequency range of the

455
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:23,440
original signal.

456
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,280
Also, as I alluded to, is the
notion that you can take lots

457
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,460
of signals and transmit them

458
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,650
simultaneously over one channel--

459
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:35,400
whether the channel is a wire,
a microwave link, a satellite

460
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,650
link, or whatever--

461
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:40,430
again, using the idea
of modulation.

462
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:45,460
And what that process
is referred to as is

463
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,680
multiplexing.

464
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,270
And let me just quickly
indicate what that

465
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:53,280
multiplexing process
corresponds to.

466
00:30:53,280 --> 00:31:00,560
We could think, for example,
of taking one signal and

467
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:06,760
modulating in it onto one
carrier with one carrier

468
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:12,280
frequency, taking a second
signal, modulating it onto a

469
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:16,690
different carrier frequency,
taking a third signal and

470
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:20,940
modulating it onto a third
carrier frequency, et cetera.

471
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:26,520
And if we choose these carrier
frequencies appropriately,

472
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:30,380
then we can add all
those together--

473
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:33,540
and do it in such a way that
the spectra don't overlap--

474
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:38,920
and end up with one broader band
signal that incorporates

475
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:45,070
the information simultaneously
in all of those signals.

476
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:49,690
So just to illustrate that
in the frequency domain.

477
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:56,890
What we have are our three
spectra, Xa, Xb, and Xc.

478
00:31:56,890 --> 00:32:01,020
And we would, for example,
take this spectrum and

479
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:05,780
modulate it to a carrier
frequency, omega sub a.

480
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:09,140
We can take this spectrum and
modulate it to a carrier

481
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:14,600
frequency, omega sub b, where
omega sub b is chosen so that

482
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:18,140
when we add these two together
they don't overlap, so that

483
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,640
they can eventually
be separated out.

484
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,380
And then we can do the same
thing with the third signal,

485
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:27,990
and put that in a frequency
range over here, being careful

486
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:30,330
that none of those overlap.

487
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:32,720
And when we add all those
together, the composite

488
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,890
spectrum is what I show here.

489
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:43,430
And as you can see, essentially,
by doing

490
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:46,280
appropriate band-pass filtering
we can pull out

491
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:50,710
whatever part of the spectrum
we choose to, and then

492
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:53,020
demodulate that in the
appropriate way.

493
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,740
And of course we can do this,
not just with three signals,

494
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:59,140
but perhaps with tens or
hundreds of signals.

495
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:03,460
So that's a process that is
typically referred to as

496
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,380
multiplexing.

497
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:08,130
And as I've described it here,
it's referred to as

498
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:10,460
frequency-division
multiplexing.

499
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:14,030
That is, dividing the frequency
band into cells and

500
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:19,560
plunking different signals
into each one of those.

501
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:23,650
And so if we want now to recover
one of those channels

502
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:27,250
in a frequency-division
multiplex system, as I

503
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:31,060
indicated, we would
first demultiplex.

504
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:35,590
Demultiplexing corresponding to
pulling out the appropriate

505
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:40,020
channel with a band-pass
filter.

506
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:45,190
And after demultiplexing, we
would then demodulate.

507
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:50,510
And we would demodulate with the
carrier appropriate to the

508
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:52,340
channel that we've pulled out.

509
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:56,800
And the demodulation, of course,
involves multiplying

510
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,790
by the carrier and doing
appropriate low-pass filtering

511
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:03,510
to finally get the
signal back.

512
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:13,850
And frequency-division
multiplexing is the type of

513
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:18,679
multiplexing that's used, for
example, in typical broadcast

514
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:22,090
AM radio systems, where
all the channels are

515
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:23,780
superimposed together.

516
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:26,520
And it's your home radio
receiver that does the

517
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,760
appropriate demultiplexing
and demodulating.

518
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,800
And of course, you can see that
not only is modulation an

519
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,830
important part of that, but as
I alluded to in the last

520
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:40,750
lecture, filtering also becomes
important part of

521
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:42,000
these practical systems.

522
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:51,070
Now, the kind of amplitude
modulation that I've talked

523
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:57,310
about so far is what's referred
to as synchronous

524
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:58,880
modulation.

525
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:04,060
And the reason for the term
synchronous is that what's

526
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:10,520
implied in these systems is a
synchronization between the

527
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,550
transmitter and receiver.

528
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:19,200
In particular, in the system as
we've talked about it, the

529
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:29,010
modulator and the demodulator
have a synchronization in both

530
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:30,790
frequency and phase.

531
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:33,630
The phase here is indicated
as theta sub c.

532
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:39,860
And if we take a look at the
demodulator, the demodulator

533
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:44,980
has phase of theta sub c.

534
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:50,620
And in general, there's the
issue of whether we can

535
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:53,480
maintain that synchronization
between the modulator and

536
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,830
demodulator.

537
00:35:54,830 --> 00:36:00,160
And so what we want to examine
now, more generally, is what

538
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,750
the consequence might be, and
the solution to the resulting

539
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:09,300
problems, if we don't have
synchronization between the

540
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,380
modulator and demodulator.

541
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:14,070
Synchronization in
terms of phase.

542
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:18,260
And there also is another
problem, which is the issue of

543
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:21,230
synchronization in frequency.

544
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:23,840
That's examined more
in the text.

545
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,330
And what I'll focus on here
is just the issue of

546
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:28,900
synchronization in phase, to
give you some sense of what

547
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,920
the issue is.

548
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,240
So now what we want to look at
is what happens if we have a

549
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:43,580
modulator with phase, theta sub
c, and a demodulator where

550
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:47,440
the phase, instead of being
theta sub c, is some other

551
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,280
phase, phi sub c.

552
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:56,260
And if you track through the
details and the algebra, then

553
00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:02,040
what you'll find is that the
output of the low-pass filter,

554
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:07,650
rather than being x of t, the
signal that we want, is x of t

555
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:10,660
multiplied by a scale factor.

556
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:13,340
And the scale factor is the
cosine of the phase

557
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,790
difference.

558
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:18,910
Now one could ask, OK well,
what's the big deal about

559
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:19,790
scale factor?

560
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:21,930
If it's too small we'll make it
big, it it's too big we'll

561
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:23,680
make it small.

562
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,000
But there are several points.

563
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,600
One is, notice, for example,
that if the phase difference

564
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:32,750
between the modulator and
demodulator is 90 degrees,

565
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:36,920
then the output of the
demodulator is zero.

566
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,970
Or if it isn't quite
90 degrees, the

567
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:41,580
amplitude might be small.

568
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:44,300
And the implication would be
that if there's other noise it

569
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,980
gets injected in the system,
the signal-to-noise

570
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,120
ratio is very low.

571
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:55,430
Now even worse is the issue
that if there's a phase

572
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:58,220
difference, but the exact
phase difference isn't

573
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:01,990
maintained, so that the
modulator and demodulator kind

574
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:05,990
of fade in and out of phase,
then the output of the

575
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:14,240
demodulator is x of t multiplied
by a time-varying

576
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,740
fading term, which is the
cosine of the phase

577
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:17,500
difference.

578
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:21,080
Well what that means,
essentially, is that if you

579
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:26,470
use this kind of system to do
the demodulation, then what

580
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:31,860
you need to be careful about is
maintaining synchronization

581
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:35,560
in phase, and also in frequency,
between the

582
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:39,470
modulator and the demodulator.

583
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:44,200
Now there are alternatives
to this.

584
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:48,590
And the alternative is what's
referred to as asynchronous

585
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:50,420
demodulation.

586
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:54,530
And let me indicate what the
idea behind asynchronous

587
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:57,760
demodulation is.

588
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,190
Now, recall that what we've done
in amplitude modulation

589
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:06,040
is to take the carrier signal
and vary its amplitude with

590
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,070
the signal that eventually
we want to get back.

591
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:12,530
So if we look at the
amplitude-modulated waveform,

592
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:16,880
it might typically look
as I indicate here.

593
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:22,910
And we're trying to get
back the envelope.

594
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:26,060
Well, one could imagine
building a circuit, or

595
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:28,450
designing a device, which
in some sense

596
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:30,490
will track the envelope.

597
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:36,550
And a common circuit to do
that is a fairly simple

598
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:41,750
circuit consisting of a diode
and a resistor and capacitor

599
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,230
in parallel.

600
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:48,580
The idea being that the
capacitor charges up as this

601
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:50,920
waveform moves up to its peak.

602
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:55,690
And then as the waveform drops
down, the capacitor discharges

603
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:56,760
through the resistor.

604
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,520
And it kind of tracks
the envelope.

605
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,740
In fact, the kind of output that
we would get is the type

606
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:07,150
of behavior that I've
indicated here.

607
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:13,090
And then that is a type
of demodulation.

608
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:15,570
It's a demodulation that
doesn't require

609
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:19,470
synchronization between the
modulator and demodulator.

610
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:25,400
And it's fairly inexpensive
to build.

611
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:30,660
But it has, obviously, some
tradeoffs associated with it.

612
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:34,580
Well, to indicate where the
tradeoff comes from, or where

613
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:39,210
the issue surfaces, notice
that what we're doing is

614
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:43,420
tracking the envelope of
the sinusoidal signal.

615
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:46,110
And we're calling that, or we're
assuming that that is

616
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:50,010
our original signal, x of t.

617
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:56,300
Well, suppose that x of t, the
original signal, is sometimes

618
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:59,090
positive and sometimes
negative.

619
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:03,490
What might we see as we look
at the output of the

620
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:04,590
demodulator?

621
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:07,950
Well, the output of the
demodulator would follow the

622
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:11,570
envelope down, and then
it would follow the

623
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:13,940
envelope back up again.

624
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:17,090
In other words, what it would
tend to generate is a

625
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:20,680
full-wave rectified version of
the signal that you were

626
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,610
really trying to get back.

627
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:24,970
Now, there's a simple
solution to this.

628
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:30,290
The simple solution is to make
sure that the signal that is

629
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:33,510
the modulating signal, x of
t, never goes negative.

630
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:38,460
So if it happens to-- a voice
signal tends to go negative.

631
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:42,570
If it happens to, we can simply
add a constant to it,

632
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:44,540
add a large enough constant,
so that it

633
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,670
always stays positive.

634
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,840
Well let's look at that.

635
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,845
What we want to do then, if
we're considering asynchronous

636
00:41:52,845 --> 00:42:03,090
demodulation, is to take our
original signal, x of t, and

637
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:07,960
add to it a constant, where
the constant is made large

638
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:13,300
enough so that we're sure that
this is a positive signal.

639
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,410
And incidentally, let me just
draw your attention to the

640
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:19,870
fact that I'm now suppressing
the phase on the carrier

641
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:24,280
signal, since the phase is not
important to the argument and

642
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:28,550
it's just some additional
notation to carry around.

643
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:32,040
So the idea then, is add
a constant to x of t.

644
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:36,530
Notice that if we just take this
term and expand it out

645
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:41,940
into two terms, x of t cosine
omega c t plus a times cosine

646
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:47,690
omega c t, then in block diagram
terms we can represent

647
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:50,430
that as I've shown here.

648
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:56,090
And so it would correspond to
modulating the signal, x of t,

649
00:42:56,090 --> 00:43:01,430
onto the carrier, omega sub c
t, and also injecting some

650
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:05,500
carrier with an amplitude,
A. And the output of the

651
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,920
modulator is then the
sum of those two.

652
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:14,610
And depending on exactly what
this value A is will influence

653
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:16,610
what the envelope
will look like.

654
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:21,140
And I indicate below,
two possibilities.

655
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:26,110
One is where I've made A fairly
large, and one is where

656
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:29,350
I've made A significantly
smaller.

657
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:34,010
And there are both positive and
negative issues associated

658
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:36,860
with whether A is too large
or A is too small.

659
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:49,300
For example, if A is large in
relation to the amplitude of

660
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:53,360
the signal, then this envelope
tends to be very flat.

661
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:56,510
And it tends to be easy to
track it with that simple

662
00:43:56,510 --> 00:44:03,450
diode RC circuit, as compared
with the case down here.

663
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:09,060
On the other hand, there is a
price that you pay for this

664
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,660
kind of envelope.

665
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:13,350
And the price that you pay is
perhaps best seen in the

666
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:15,720
frequency domain.

667
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:19,650
If we look in the frequency
domain, here is

668
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:22,620
our original spectrum.

669
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:27,450
Here is the spectrum at the
output of the modulator.

670
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:31,030
And the impulse that occurs
here corresponds to the

671
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:33,370
carrier that's injected.

672
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:37,510
The larger A is, the more
carrier is injected.

673
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:41,900
The more carrier that's
injected, the easier it is for

674
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:45,960
the envelope detector
to demodulate.

675
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:49,360
So one can ask, why not
just put a lot in?

676
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:54,670
Well, the obvious answer
is that it's not an

677
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:58,130
information-carrying
part of the signal.

678
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:01,670
And so in some sense it
represents an inefficiency in

679
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:04,890
transmission, because what
you're transmitting is power,

680
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:08,820
energy, that doesn't have
any information

681
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:09,900
associated with it.

682
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:13,120
It's simply the injection
of a carrier to make the

683
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:18,770
demodulation for an asynchronous
demodulator--

684
00:45:18,770 --> 00:45:23,630
to make the demodulation
easier.

685
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:25,340
And so there's this tradeoff.

686
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:29,590
And in fact, one represents
the tradeoff and the

687
00:45:29,590 --> 00:45:32,230
associated parameters very
often in terms of percent

688
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:40,240
modulation, where the percent
modulation is essentially the

689
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:45,280
ratio of the maximum signal
level to the amplitude of the

690
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,380
injected carrier.

691
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:52,750
And depending on whether the
modulation's very high or very

692
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:57,670
low, the tradeoff is that
the transmission is more

693
00:45:57,670 --> 00:45:59,800
inefficient and it takes
more energy, but the

694
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,190
demodulator is simpler.

695
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:04,910
Or the demodulator is more
complicated but the

696
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:06,840
transmission is simpler.

697
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,780
Now, there are situations where
you might very well want

698
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:10,720
to use one or the other.

699
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:16,670
For example, in home radio
you're often willing to

700
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:21,610
transmit a lot of power so that
you can have inexpensive

701
00:46:21,610 --> 00:46:24,100
consumer-oriented receivers.

702
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,790
On the other hand, in satellite
communication you're

703
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:31,070
willing to pay a very high price
for the modulators and

704
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:34,620
demodulators, but it's the
amount of power that's

705
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:37,010
transmitted that's
at a premium.

706
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:41,120
And so in one case, satellite
communication, you would use

707
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:43,890
synchronous modulation
and demodulation.

708
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:46,090
Whereas in typical
consumer-oriented

709
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:54,000
broadcasting, you would use
an asynchronous system and

710
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,980
transmit more power, even if
it's inefficient, so that the

711
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:00,470
demodulator can be simpler.

712
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:06,400
Now, in the asynchronous system,
as we've indicated,

713
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,970
there's one source of
inefficiency, which is this

714
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:11,900
injection of the carrier.

715
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:16,930
There also is a somewhat
different issue, related to

716
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:21,120
inefficiency in sinusoidal
amplitude modulation.

717
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:26,710
And it's an inefficiency that is
separate from the issue of

718
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:28,850
synchronous versus asynchronous
systems.

719
00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:31,760
In other words, it's not
associated with the injection

720
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,410
of the carrier, it's a
very different issue.

721
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:38,140
Let me indicate what that is.

722
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:44,050
Let's look again at the spectrum
of x of t, which I've

723
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:45,960
indicated here.

724
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:54,600
And in a sinusoidal amplitude
modulation system, we would

725
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:58,650
center it around plus and minus
the carrier frequency.

726
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:02,500
Now, notice that in the original
system we occupy a

727
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:07,490
frequency spectrum that's 2
times omega sub M. By the time

728
00:48:07,490 --> 00:48:11,450
we've shifted it, thinking
of positive and negative

729
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:15,660
frequencies, we've used
up twice as much of

730
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:17,950
the frequency spectrum.

731
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:22,300
Well you could say, OK, let's
just shift this up this way

732
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:24,470
and get rid of this part.

733
00:48:24,470 --> 00:48:25,860
That's of course what
the complex

734
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:27,860
exponential carrier did.

735
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:31,360
And the issue there is that
now you've got to transmit

736
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:35,110
both a real part and
an imaginary part.

737
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:39,190
So what you can think about, and
ask, is if you still want

738
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:43,760
to transmit a real-valued
signal, how can you somehow

739
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:47,540
remove the inefficiency or
redundancy in the spectrum?

740
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:52,750
Well, notice that what we have
is this spectrum moved here,

741
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:55,090
and moved here.

742
00:48:55,090 --> 00:49:02,180
And we could imagine building
real-valued signal by

743
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:06,770
eliminating what I refer to here
as the lower sideband out

744
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:11,210
of the positive frequencies, and
the lower sideband out of

745
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:13,710
the negative frequencies.

746
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:18,650
And in effect, what we've done
is taken just the positive

747
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:22,510
frequencies here, shifted
them there, the negative

748
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:24,460
frequencies here, and
shifted them here.

749
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:29,000
And the resulting spectrum
is what I indicate below.

750
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,840
Well, this is what
is often done.

751
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:37,020
And what it's referred to
as is single sideband.

752
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:40,790
What we've done is kept the
upper sideband, in this

753
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:42,050
particular case.

754
00:49:42,050 --> 00:49:46,390
We could alternatively think
of putting this system

755
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:52,760
together where we retain the
lower sideband instead of the

756
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,250
upper sideband.

757
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:59,870
And in either case, what we've
removed is an inefficiency in

758
00:49:59,870 --> 00:50:01,760
transmission of the signal.

759
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:05,380
Namely we have a real-valued
signal, but it only requires

760
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:10,710
as much total bandwidth, in
terms of the frequencies in

761
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:14,480
which there's energy present,
as the original signal.

762
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,190
Well how do we do this?

763
00:50:16,190 --> 00:50:18,160
There are a variety of ways.

764
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:22,810
And there's one procedure that
is discussed in more detail in

765
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:26,160
the text, which uses what's
referred to as a 90 degree

766
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,690
phase splitter.

767
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:30,720
The simplest way, at least
conceptually, is to think

768
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,420
about doing it with filtering.

769
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:39,810
And the idea simply is that if
we have our modulated signal--

770
00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:41,810
here's the spectrum of
the modulated signal.

771
00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:44,780
And if that modulated signal
is simply put through a

772
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:51,740
high-pass filter, then the
result will be to eliminate

773
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:56,240
the lower sideband, if we choose
the high-pass filter to

774
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:59,530
have a characteristic
as I indicate here.

775
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:03,820
So this, conceptually, is a
very sharp cutoff filter.

776
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:06,810
And what it eliminates are
the lower sidebands.

777
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:11,770
And the resulting spectrum
is what we have below.

778
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:17,870
And this in fact is really
the basic idea behind

779
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:20,130
single-sideband transmission.

780
00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:22,180
Again, there's a tradeoff.

781
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:26,280
It's clearly more efficient
than double-sideband

782
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:32,770
transmission, but also has the
complication, or additional

783
00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:35,760
issue, that the modulator
becomes a little more

784
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,240
complicated because you need
this filtering operation, or

785
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,770
some equivalent operation,
to get rid of

786
00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:43,020
the unwanted sideband.

787
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:52,050
Well, this is a fairly quick
tour through a variety of

788
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:53,990
issues related to modulation.

789
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:58,180
And it really is just the tip
of the iceberg, obviously.

790
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:02,180
Modulation in the context of
sinusoidal modulation, as

791
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:06,710
we've talked about, has a
lot of detailed issues

792
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:09,030
associated with it.

793
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:14,220
It's important to recognize, and
to be somewhat pleased by

794
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:19,030
the fact, that not only with the
mathematical foundations

795
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:24,130
that we've developed can we
understand the basics of

796
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:25,610
sinusoidal amplitude
modulation.

797
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:32,190
But what you'll find if you dig
into this somewhat deeper

798
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:35,940
that the basic background that
we built up so far--

799
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:38,190
the mathematical tools--

800
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:42,080
are really pretty much what
you need for a much deeper

801
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:44,505
understanding of all of
the issues involved.

802
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:51,800
So from what might have seemed
like a fairly abstract

803
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,920
mathematical property associated
with the Fourier

804
00:52:54,920 --> 00:53:00,460
transform, we've begun to
develop what should give you

805
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:05,000
the sense of some important
practical considerations.

806
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,770
And as we'll see the next
lecture, very much the same

807
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:15,350
kinds of notions apply for
discrete time, sinusoidal, and

808
00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:19,000
complex exponential amplitude
modulation.

809
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,060
And also as I indicated at the
beginning of the lecture, in

810
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:27,120
the next lecture we'll also talk
about what's referred to

811
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,770
as pulse amplitude modulation.

812
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:30,770
It's a different kind
of carrier.

813
00:53:30,770 --> 00:53:36,260
And what that will lead to,
among other things, is a very

814
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:43,540
important bridge between the
notions of continuous time and

815
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:45,080
the notions of discrete time.

816
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,330
Thank you.
