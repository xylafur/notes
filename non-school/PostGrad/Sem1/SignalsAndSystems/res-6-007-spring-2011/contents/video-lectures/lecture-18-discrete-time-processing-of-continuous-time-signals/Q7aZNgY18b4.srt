2
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:46,020
PROFESSOR: Last time, we
began the discussion of

3
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,510
discreet-time processing of
continuous-time signals.

4
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:56,170
And, as a reminder, let me
review the basic notion.

5
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:03,880
The idea was that we convert
from a continuous-time signal

6
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:09,900
to a sequence through an
operation which I represent as

7
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,890
a continuous to discrete
time converter.

8
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:22,740
And then that sequence is used
as the input to an appropriate

9
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,000
discreet-time system.

10
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,250
And after appropriate
discreet-time processing, that

11
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:35,820
sequence is converted back to
a continuous-time signal

12
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,960
through an operation which
I label as a discrete to

13
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,180
continuous time converter.

14
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:49,630
Now, in the lecture last time,
we carried out some analysis

15
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:54,910
which related for us the spectra
in the first step of

16
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,250
this operation.

17
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,730
Namely in the transformation
from a continuous-time time

18
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,520
signal to a sequence.

19
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,290
And let me, by the way, draw
your attention to the fact

20
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:12,970
that, in the real world, this
operation is essentially

21
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:17,540
implemented by what you would
typically label as an analog

22
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,430
to digital converter, if in
fact the discreet-time

23
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,990
processing is being
done digitally.

24
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,290
Now, it's important to emphasize
that it's not

25
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:30,290
exactly what an analog to
digital converter does, but,

26
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:34,060
in some sense at least, you
should think of this mapping

27
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,180
from continuous-time to
discreet-time in very much the

28
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,070
same way that one would
think of an

29
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,760
analog to digital converter.

30
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:47,790
And the mapping back then
corresponds, in some sense, to

31
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:52,330
what would happen with a digital
to analog converter.

32
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:56,620
Well, let me review what is
involved in the mapping from

33
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,460
the continuous-time signal
to the sequence.

34
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:04,470
And, let me stress again that,
this operation is basically--

35
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:07,400
in the continuous to
discreet-time conversion--

36
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,170
a two-step process.

37
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:13,940
In the first part of the
process, the continuous-time

38
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:20,740
signal is modulated with impulse
train, where the

39
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:25,510
period of the impulse train is
capital T. And so we have a

40
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:29,980
continuous-time time impulse
train signal which captures

41
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:35,470
the samples of the original
continuous-time signal.

42
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:42,280
That impulse train is then put
through an operation which,

43
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:49,100
essentially, re-labels the
samples so that the sample

44
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:55,400
values, the impulse areas, are
re-labeled as sequence values.

45
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,520
And the result of that
conversion is then the

46
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,020
sequence x of n.

47
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:06,930
So the overall process, then,
is a sampling process,

48
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,610
followed by what is simply,
in this box,

49
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,510
a re-labeling process.

50
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:18,110
And, although as I indicated
just a minute ago, that is

51
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:21,100
essentially what an analog to
digital converter does.

52
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,770
An analog to digital converter
doesn't necessarily carry it

53
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:30,280
out in those two steps, but
particularly, in terms of

54
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,610
carrying through an analysis,
thinking of it as a two-step

55
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,890
process is particularly
convenient.

56
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:43,200
Now we talked last time about
what this mapping from

57
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,370
continuous-time to discreet-time
means, both in

58
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,210
the time domain, and terms
of the spectra.

59
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:53,530
And in particular, in the time
domain we begin with the

60
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:58,550
continuous-time signal, which
is then sampled with an

61
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:04,010
impulse train and converted
to a sequence by simply

62
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:08,020
generating a sequence
whose values are the

63
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,490
areas of the impulses.

64
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:14,420
And I stress the fact that
what this corresponds to,

65
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,620
essentially, is a normalization
of the time

66
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:23,950
axis, essentially, by dividing
the time axis by capital T.

67
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:29,430
In the frequency domain, then,
we had the spectrum of the

68
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:33,150
original signal, which, because
of the sampling

69
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:40,210
process, is replicated at
integer multiples of the

70
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:45,780
sampling frequency omega sub s,
or 2 pi over capital T. And

71
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:51,480
then, in converting the impulses
to a sequence, we are

72
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:57,150
essentially normalizing the
frequency axis, so that the

73
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:01,970
frequency 2 pi over capital
T gets re-labeled as 2 pi.

74
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:05,130
And the resulting discreet-time
spectrum looks

75
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,110
like I indicate here.

76
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:12,310
Which really is nothing more
than a frequency scaling

77
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:15,140
corresponding to the associated
time scaling.

78
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:19,070
So the mapping from the impulse
train spectrum to the

79
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:23,450
discreet-time spectrum
corresponds to a mapping

80
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:27,620
specified by capital omega equal
to small omega times

81
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,800
capital T.

82
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:35,470
And equivalently, it's the
frequency 2 pi over capital T,

83
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:39,670
which is, of course, the
sampling frequency which gets

84
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:44,730
normalized to the
frequency 2 pi.

85
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:49,070
And so, in the frequency domain,
there is a frequency

86
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:55,620
normalization associated with
the fact that corresponding to

87
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:01,290
this spectrum is a time sequence
or discreet-time

88
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:05,030
sequence, as I showed
previously, and the

89
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:10,900
discreet-time sequence is
related to the original

90
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:16,600
continuous-time signal through
a time normalization.

91
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:22,840
In other words, these sequence
values are simply samples of

92
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,510
the continuous-time signal
with the time axis

93
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,760
renormalized.

94
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:31,910
Now, what we want
to consider--

95
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,070
this is the conversion from
continuous-time to

96
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,260
discreet-time--

97
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:39,960
what we want to consider now
is the overall system which

98
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,960
implements not just the
conversion, but filtering, and

99
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,360
then coming back out of
the conversion back to

100
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,630
continuous-time.

101
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:51,400
So let's look at the
overall system.

102
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,610
And the overall system, of
course, as I've stressed

103
00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:01,080
several times in the past,
consists of first, the

104
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:09,980
sampling process, conversion to
an impulse train, and the

105
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:13,530
impulse train converted
to a sequence.

106
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:18,430
That sequence is then processed
through our

107
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:21,180
discreet-time filter.

108
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:25,770
And after the discreet-time time
processing, the result of

109
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:30,700
that is converted back
to an impulse train.

110
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:35,710
So this resulting process
sequence is then converted

111
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,980
back to an impulse train.

112
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:43,700
And then, finally, we carry out
the desampling process by

113
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:49,900
simply using a low-pass filter
with a cutoff associated with

114
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,170
the sampling frequency
that we used.

115
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:57,620
Now, typically in a system like
that-- which implements

116
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,690
discreet-time processing of
continuous-time time signals--

117
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:07,030
we need to ensure in one way or
another that the bandwidth

118
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:10,100
of the input is sufficiently
limited, so

119
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,010
that we avoid aliasing.

120
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:16,300
One way to do that is to force
it one way or another, or

121
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,190
simply know that our signal
satisfies the bandwidth

122
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,160
constraint.

123
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,190
Although, a fairly typical thing
to do in addition to

124
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:30,770
this sampling process is to
include what is referred to an

125
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,440
anti-aliasing filter.

126
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,580
In other words, this is a filter
that would band-limit

127
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:43,090
the input at at least half the
sampling frequency, so that we

128
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:47,850
are guaranteed, then, that there
is no aliasing that's

129
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:50,400
carried out in this process.

130
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:55,000
And it's important to stress
that, in this kind of

131
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,610
processing--

132
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:59,190
discreet-time processing of
continuous-time signals--

133
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:02,400
except in certain special
situations, it's very

134
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,750
important to avoid aliasing
because we're going to want to

135
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,660
do a reconstruction after
we do the sampling and

136
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,910
processing.

137
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:17,070
OK, now, this is the sequence
of steps in the time domain.

138
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:20,610
Let's examine what happens as
a consequence of this in the

139
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:23,240
frequency domain.

140
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,730
Well, let's choose some
type of simple

141
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,500
representative spectrum.

142
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,320
And, of course, what's important
about it is that the

143
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,620
spectrum we choose is
band-limited, or that there's

144
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,470
an anti-aliasing filter.

145
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:41,080
And it's not the shape, of
course, that is critical.

146
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:45,140
And as we work our way through
the system, this is the

147
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,460
continuous-time spectrum.

148
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:53,530
After sampling, that spectrum is
replicated at multiples of

149
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:54,690
the sampling frequency--

150
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,840
integer multiples of the
sampling frequency--

151
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,560
and so there would be another
one over here, and another one

152
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,380
over here, et cetera.

153
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:05,370
And then, in converting to a
discreet-time sequence, there

154
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:10,500
is the associated frequency
normalization, so that the

155
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,360
sampling frequency gets
normalized to a

156
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,230
frequency of 2 pi.

157
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:26,670
OK, now, at that point, where
we are in the system is at

158
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:30,750
this point, so that we've
converted to a sequence.

159
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:34,350
We now want to carry out some
filtering, and then, after

160
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:40,060
that filtering, convert back to
a continuous-time signal.

161
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:45,790
All right, so, here we are at
the spectrum associated with

162
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:49,040
the sequence.

163
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,410
And now, the processing that
we're carrying out is linear

164
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:57,380
time and variant filtering in
the discreet-time domain.

165
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:01,560
And what that corresponds to,
then, is multiplying this

166
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,080
spectrum by the filter
frequency response.

167
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,250
And I've chosen a particular
shape.

168
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,430
And again, it's not the shape
that's important to the

169
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:14,310
discussion, but the fact, for
example, that it has a

170
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:18,070
particular cutoff frequency,
which we will track as we work

171
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,790
through this.

172
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:24,550
And so now, the spectrum of
y of n, the output of the

173
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:30,120
digital filter, is the product
of this spectrum, and the

174
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,940
Fourier transform, or frequency
response, of the

175
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,190
digital filter.

176
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,060
Now, in working our way through,
we're going to take

177
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:43,880
the output of the filter and
undo the two-step process.

178
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,700
So we now want to take that
sequence, convert it to an

179
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,600
impulse train, and then take
that impulse train and

180
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,460
desample through a
low-pass filter.

181
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:59,220
So, here we are now at the
output of the digital filter.

182
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,340
We then convert that to
an impulse train.

183
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:05,730
Well that's really undoing the
original time normalization.

184
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:10,520
And so, what that means, is
that we are undoing the

185
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,080
frequency normalization.

186
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:17,320
In particular, we're dividing
the frequency axis by capital

187
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:24,610
T. Whereas, this point in y of
omega was 2 pi, now it's 2 pi

188
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:29,540
over capital T. What that means
is that, equivalently,

189
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:33,550
we're multiplying this spectrum
by the frequency

190
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:36,270
response of the digital
filter, but now

191
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:40,225
linearly-scaled in frequency,
so that what was a cutoff

192
00:13:40,225 --> 00:13:44,830
frequency of omega sub c is now
cutoff frequency of omega

193
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:48,590
sub c, divided by capital T.

194
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:53,760
So now, the next step in the
process is the reconstructing

195
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,290
low-pass filter.

196
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:59,090
And what that extracts is simply
the portion of this

197
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:02,020
periodic spectrum around
the origin.

198
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:06,550
And so finally, then, the
spectrum of the output of the

199
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:11,920
overall system will be the
spectrum of the input

200
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:19,680
multiplied by a frequency
response, which is the digital

201
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:25,040
filter frequency response
frequency scaled by dividing

202
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,360
that digital filter frequency
axis by capital T.

203
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,580
OK, now, what we can ask is,
we've got this processing--

204
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,390
we've converted to
discreet-time, and we've gone

205
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:41,590
back to continuous-time, and
one can ask now what

206
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:45,010
equivalent, overall
continuous-time system does

207
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,970
that correspond to?

208
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,550
In other words, if we--

209
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,730
that, of course, is a
continuous-time system, it's a

210
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:53,790
continuous-time input and
continuous-time time output--

211
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:58,980
and the overall system, then,
would be one that would give

212
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,540
us exactly the same output
spectrum as we're getting.

213
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,200
Well, what is that?

214
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,480
What we have is an output
spectrum, which is the product

215
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,790
of the input spectrum and the
digital filter frequency

216
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:16,150
characteristic frequency-scaled.

217
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:23,420
And so, in fact, the resulting
continuous-time time filter is

218
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:27,210
simply the digital
filter with an

219
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:29,120
appropriate frequency scaling.

220
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,710
In other words, with the
frequency axis divided by

221
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:42,200
capital T. So said another
way, if we show here the

222
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:51,090
frequency response of the
original digital filter, then

223
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:56,150
the corresponding
continuous-time filter would

224
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:59,470
be this, frequency-scaled.

225
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:02,930
And then, because of the
associated low-pass filtering

226
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:06,810
and the reconstruction, we would
select out just one of

227
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:10,070
these periods-- in particular,
the portion around the origin.

228
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:13,270
And the essential consequence
of that is that the

229
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,900
corresponding continuous-time
filter,

230
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,790
then, is given by this.

231
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:24,150
And these two are related simply
by a linear scaling of

232
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,840
the frequency axis.

233
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,830
And note that, where the digital
filter has a cutoff

234
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:33,100
frequency of omega sub c, the
continuous-time filter has a

235
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:38,560
cutoff frequency of omega sub
c divided by capital T.

236
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,750
So that's the linear
frequency scaling.

237
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:45,690
And, by the way, plant away for
now-- and we'll return to

238
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:48,170
this point later--

239
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:52,960
the observation that even if the
digital filter frequency

240
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:57,720
response is fixed, which we
would assume it is, by

241
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,740
changing the sampling frequency,
in fact, what we're

242
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:05,510
able to do is affect a linear
scaling all of the equivalent

243
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:09,170
continuous-time filter.

244
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:12,960
OK, well, this is pretty much
the process and the analysis,

245
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:17,390
but to highlight a number of the
issues and emphasize these

246
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:24,530
points, what I'd like to do is
illustrate some of this with a

247
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:29,840
videotape demonstration that,
in fact, was made originally

248
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:35,390
as part of another course-- a
course devoted entirely to

249
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:38,120
digital signal processing,
which essentially is

250
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,200
discreet-time time processing,
whether or not it's related to

251
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,060
continuous-time signals.

252
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:48,240
And what I'd like to now focus
on are some of the details of

253
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,980
that demonstration.

254
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:57,450
In the demonstration, the
specific impulse response that

255
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:01,600
is used for the digital filter,
or discreet-time

256
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,160
filter, is the one
that I show here.

257
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:12,360
And the associated frequency
response is the frequency

258
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,460
response of a discreet-time,
low-pass filter,

259
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,800
as I indicate below.

260
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,520
And the cutoff frequency
of that filter--

261
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,890
as I indicate, the filter was
designed as a discreet-time

262
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:28,680
filter with a cutoff frequency
of pi over 5.

263
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:32,540
And let me just draw your
attention to the fact that pi

264
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:39,200
over 5 is also a 10th of 2 pi.

265
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,140
And so in fact the digital or
discreet-time filter cutoff

266
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,250
frequency is a 10th of 2 pi.

267
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:51,230
And as I'll stress again
shortly, remember that, in the

268
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:55,670
frequency normalization or
unnormalization, 2 pi

269
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:58,940
represents, in effect, the
sampling frequency.

270
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:03,080
And so the consequence of that
is that the cutoff frequency

271
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,750
really, is going to be
associated with a 10th of the

272
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,760
sampling frequency.

273
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,720
But, for now, keep in
mind that it's just

274
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,040
simply a 10th of 2 pi.

275
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:19,040
Now, the equivalent
continuous-time system, in

276
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:23,600
terms of the impulse response,
is, of course, a band-limited

277
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:31,350
interpolation of the impulse
response associated with the

278
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,380
discreet-time filter.

279
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,080
And in the frequency domain,
the frequency response is

280
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:44,380
correspondingly a time-scaled,
frequency scaled version of

281
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,290
the frequency response.

282
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:50,900
So, in fact, in the frequency
domain and in the time domain

283
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:57,320
related to the continuous-time
signal, the associated impulse

284
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,540
response is what I
indicate here--

285
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:04,950
a band-limited interpolation of
the discreet-time impulse

286
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:09,340
response and time
scale, in fact.

287
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,000
And the frequency response--

288
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,680
following the discussion
that we've

289
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,410
previously gone through--

290
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:18,390
is a frequency-scaled version of
the one associated with the

291
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,630
digital filter.

292
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:24,190
Well, the first thing that I'll
want to look at is the

293
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,980
impulse response.

294
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:32,370
And when we do, let me just
indicate that in the actual

295
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:36,350
implementation things are
slightly different than they

296
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:39,720
are associated with the
ideal analysis.

297
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:46,920
In particular, in converting
from a discreet-time sequence

298
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:52,070
to the continuous-time signal,
whereas this way of looking at

299
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:56,530
it is convenient in the context
of the analysis, in

300
00:20:56,530 --> 00:21:02,830
fact, the way it's done is using
a more or less standard

301
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,840
digital to analog converter.

302
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,530
And what a digital to analog
converter does, as I indicated

303
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:13,900
in the previous lecture, is to
convert the sequence not to an

304
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:17,400
impulse train but, in fact,
to go directly through a

305
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,930
zero-order hold.

306
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:22,140
And so, usually what comes out
of a digital to analog

307
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:27,590
converter is a staircase type
of signal associated with a

308
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,150
zero-order hold.

309
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:33,260
And then, the result of that is
low-pass filtered to do the

310
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,590
reconstruction.

311
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:39,410
So what we'll want to look at,
then, is that reconstruction,

312
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:42,170
first with just an
impulse input.

313
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:47,420
And so, what we'll see after the
low-pass filter, for the

314
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:52,900
impulse response, is a smooth
curve like this.

315
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:57,320
But also, as part of the
demonstration, what I'll do,

316
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,300
just to show the zero-order
hold, is to take the low-pass

317
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:05,610
filter out temporarily and
then put it back in.

318
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:11,010
So first, let's just look at the
filter impulse response.

319
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:14,790
What we see here is the impulse
response of the

320
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:17,040
overall system.

321
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,600
And we observe, for one thing,
that it's a symmetrical

322
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,620
impulse response.

323
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:25,170
In other words, corresponds
to a linear phase filter.

324
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:28,190
We could also look at the
impulse response before the

325
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:31,340
desampling low-pass filter--
let's take out the desampling

326
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:34,050
low-pass filter slowly--

327
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:38,700
and what we observe is,
basically, the output of the

328
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,570
digital to analog converter.

329
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:43,440
Which, of course, is a
staircase, or boxcar,

330
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,425
function, not an
impulse train.

331
00:22:45,425 --> 00:22:48,640
In the real world, the output
of a D to A converter,

332
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,590
generally, is a boxcar
type of function.

333
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:55,990
We can put the desampling filter
back in now and notice

334
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:58,330
that the effect of the
desampling filter is,

335
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:04,210
basically, to smooth out the
rough edges in the boxcar

336
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,605
output from the D
to A converter.

337
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:12,210
OK, so, that's the impulse
response of the system.

338
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:15,910
Now, what I'd like to show
is the frequency

339
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,650
response of the system.

340
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:20,390
And to measure the frequency
response, of course, what we

341
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:28,260
can do is put a sine wave into
the system and look at the

342
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,780
sinusoidal output.

343
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:33,590
So, in particular now, what will
happen is that, with the

344
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:38,540
system, we will put in a
continuous-time sinusoid,

345
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:43,350
which is sampled, converted
to a sequence.

346
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:46,630
The sampled continuous-time
sinusoid is a

347
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:48,670
discreet-time sinusoid.

348
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:52,650
That goes through the digital
filter and gets attenuated, or

349
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:55,110
amplified appropriately.

350
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:59,400
And then the output of that is
converted back-- and that's,

351
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,450
again, a sinusoidal output--

352
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:08,000
that gets converted back to a
continuous-time sinusoid.

353
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,110
Theoretically, as I indicate
here-- but again, as we just

354
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:15,520
saw, really, represented by a
zero-order hold, followed by a

355
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,680
low-pass filter.

356
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:22,120
So, that's the overall
operation, with one

357
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,310
modification from the diagram
that we have here.

358
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:30,430
In this particular diagram
I've included and

359
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,540
anti-aliasing filter.

360
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:35,540
In fact, in the demonstration
there is no

361
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,510
anti-aliasing filter.

362
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:43,750
And so, in fact, the input is
a sinusoidal input which is

363
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:48,990
not band-limited by virtue of
an anti-aliasing filter.

364
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:53,610
It's only, of course,
band-limited appropriately if

365
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:57,530
we choose the sinusoidal
frequency that way.

366
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,900
So, there is no anti-aliasing
filter,

367
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,070
and this is the system.

368
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:09,020
And one consequence of that is
that, in fact, if we sweep the

369
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:13,900
input sinusoid only up to half
the sampling frequency, we'll

370
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,490
see no aliasing.

371
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:17,360
But if we let it sweep
past that, we're

372
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,100
going to get aliasing.

373
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:23,560
Now, in the demonstration, the
sampling rate that's picked

374
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,950
for this part of the
demonstration is a 20

375
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:28,790
kilohertz sampling rate.

376
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:31,950
That means, based on the
sampling theorem, that as long

377
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:34,940
as the input frequency
is below 10

378
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:39,300
kilohertz we get no aliasing.

379
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:43,900
When the input frequency goes
beyond 10 kilohertz , that

380
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,760
higher frequency is going
to get aliased down

381
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,670
into a lower frequency.

382
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:51,590
A consequence of that, then, is
that as we go through the

383
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:55,910
processing, and we demonstrate
the frequency response of the

384
00:25:55,910 --> 00:26:02,310
system, what we'll see in the
output is no aliasing when the

385
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,660
input is below 10 kilohertz.

386
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:08,310
As the input sweeps past
10 kilohertz--

387
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:10,450
when we let it, which we
will eventually in the

388
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:11,880
demonstration--

389
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:16,460
then, in fact, that frequency,
as it finally shows up here,

390
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:21,870
will begin to be aliased down
into a lower frequency.

391
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:26,640
Another way of thinking about
that is that, when we watch

392
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:33,090
the frequency response of the
system, as we look at the

393
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:37,750
digital filter frequency
response, what we're sweeping

394
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:45,180
as we go from 0 up to 10
kilohertz in the input

395
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:49,010
frequency is this portion of
the frequency response.

396
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:53,170
As we sweep from 10 kilohertz
out to 20 kilohertz, what

397
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:57,170
we'll see is this portion of
the frequency response.

398
00:26:57,170 --> 00:27:00,880
In other words, we'll see it
periodically replicated.

399
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:06,520
Or, if we look at the
corresponding continuous-time

400
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:10,350
frequency response, what it
means, really, is that

401
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:14,510
sweeping from 0 to
10 kilohertz is

402
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,190
moving up this way.

403
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:20,360
And then sweeping from 10
kilohertz to 20 kilohertz on

404
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:26,330
the input, really because of the
aliasing, reflects itself

405
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:30,460
in the digital filter by looking
back toward lower

406
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,590
frequencies.

407
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:36,310
And so the continuous-time
filter sweeps back down from

408
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:40,520
10 kilohertz back to 0.

409
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:44,020
OK, so, that's what we'll see,
and we'll see it in several

410
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:46,560
different ways as explained
in the demonstration.

411
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,130
So now let's look
at the frequency

412
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:51,930
response of the filter.

413
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:54,440
Now what we'd like to illustrate
is the frequency

414
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:58,610
response of the equivalent
continuous-time filter.

415
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:01,010
And we can do that by
sweeping the filter

416
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:02,880
with sinusoidal input.

417
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,890
So, what we'll see in this
demonstration is, on the upper

418
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:10,180
trace, the input sinusoid, on
the lower trace, the output

419
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:14,740
sinusoid, using a 20 kilohertz
sampling rate, and a sweep

420
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,420
from 0 to 10 kilohertz.

421
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:21,080
In other words, a sweep from 0
to, effectively, pi, in terms

422
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,320
of the digital filter.

423
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:28,430
So what we'll observe as the
input frequency increases, is

424
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:31,450
that the output sinusoid will
have, essentially, constant

425
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:35,020
amplitude up to the cutoff
frequency of the filter, and

426
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:38,170
then approximately zero
amplitude past.

427
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:41,525
So let's now sweep the filter
frequency response.

428
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:50,410
And there is the filter
cutoff frequency.

429
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:59,310
Now, we can also observe the
filter frequency response in

430
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,840
several other ways.

431
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,180
One way in which we can observe
it is by looking,

432
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:09,880
also, at the amplitude of the
output sinusoid as a function

433
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,980
of frequency, rather than
as a function of time.

434
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:16,530
And so we'll observe that
on the left-hand scope.

435
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:19,280
While on the right-hand scope,
we'll have the same trace the

436
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,760
we just saw, namely
two traces--

437
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,990
the upper trace is the inputs
sinusoid, the lower trace is

438
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,800
the output sinusoid.

439
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,730
And, in addition to observing
the frequency response, let's

440
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:35,430
also listen to the output
sinusoid and observe the

441
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:38,730
attenuation in the output as we
go from the filter passband

442
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:40,520
to the filter stopband.

443
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:44,550
Again, a 20 kilohertz sampling
rate and a sweep range from 0

444
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,800
to 10 kilohertz.

445
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:54,850
Now, of course, we're in
the filter stopband.

446
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:04,310
Now, if we increase the sweep
range from 10 kilohertz the 20

447
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:07,880
kilohertz, so that the sweep
range is equal to the sampling

448
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:11,310
frequency, in essence, that
corresponds to sweeping out

449
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:15,110
the digital filter
from 0 to 2 pi.

450
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:18,810
And, in that case, we'll begin
to see some of the periodicity

451
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:21,210
in the digital filter
frequency response.

452
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:25,890
So let's do that now with a 20
kilohertz sampling rate and a

453
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:27,870
sweep range of 0 to
20 kilohertz.

454
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:41,140
Now as we come near 2 pi, we
get back the past-band.

455
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:45,780
And, finally, back to a 0 to
10 kilohertz sweep, so that

456
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:50,130
we're again sweeping only from
0 to pi with regard to the

457
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:51,380
digital filter.

458
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:10,560
Now, an important observation
is that, with the digital or

459
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:15,040
discreet-time filter cutoff
frequency fixed as I've

460
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,130
indicated here--

461
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:20,110
and I remind you that what
the cutoff frequency is,

462
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:22,370
is a 10th of 2 pi--

463
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:26,060
with that cutoff frequency
fixed, because of the

464
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:30,470
normalization that we get
as we come back to a

465
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:35,335
continuous-time filter, in fact,
what we have is a cutoff

466
00:31:35,335 --> 00:31:41,140
frequency that is dependent on
the sampling frequency or on

467
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,620
the sampling period.

468
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:46,580
And, more specifically, since
the discreet-time, or digital,

469
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:50,010
filter or has a cutoff frequency
which is a 10th of 2

470
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:56,630
pi, the normalization, as you
recall, is that 2 pi, in

471
00:31:56,630 --> 00:32:00,780
discreet-time frequency,
corresponds to omega sub s,

472
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,750
the sampling frequency,
in terms of

473
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:05,180
continuous-time frequency.

474
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:09,540
The consequence is that this
cutoff frequency, in

475
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:13,970
fact, is 1/10 of--

476
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:16,680
not 2 pi now because of
the normalization--

477
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:20,180
it's 1/10 of the sampling
frequency.

478
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:25,980
So, consequently, as we change
the sampling frequency, what

479
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:29,010
will happen is that, even with
the discreet-time filter

480
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:33,870
cutoff fixed, the cutoff
frequency of the equivalent

481
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:37,810
continuous-time filter
will change.

482
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:40,570
Now, that's what I want
to demonstrate.

483
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:44,790
But let me again stress and ask
you to keep in mind that

484
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:47,010
this demonstration is
done without an

485
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:49,480
anti-aliasing filter in.

486
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:53,590
And we are going to be
changing the sampling

487
00:32:53,590 --> 00:33:00,650
frequency and, so keep in mind
that, as we look at this, as

488
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:04,940
the input frequency sweeps
past half the sampling

489
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,560
frequency--

490
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,680
whatever sampling frequency we
happen to be looking at--

491
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,550
then, because of the fact that
there's no anti-aliasing

492
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:14,360
filter we'll get aliasing.

493
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,230
In other words, the frequency
and the digital filter, or

494
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:21,040
discreet-time filter, as we
sweep the input frequency up,

495
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:25,280
will move up in frequency until
we get past half the

496
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:28,130
sampling frequency and then
essentially will move back

497
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:31,170
down in frequency.

498
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:33,570
Consequently, what
we'll get, then--

499
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:36,340
or what we'll see-- are periodic
replications of the

500
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:39,370
frequency response when
we swept past half

501
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:40,910
the sampling frequency.

502
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:45,440
All right, so now, let's look
at the same digital filter,

503
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,040
but the frequency response,
as we change

504
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,980
the sampling frequency.

505
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:56,070
Now, what we would like to
demonstrate is the effect of

506
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:58,450
changing the sampling
frequency.

507
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:03,930
And we know that the effective
filter cutoff frequency is

508
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:08,139
tied to the sampling frequency
and, for this particular

509
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:12,719
filter, corresponds to a 10th
of the sampling frequency.

510
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,690
Consequently, if we double the
sampling frequency, we should

511
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:20,690
double the effective filter
passband width, or double the

512
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:22,730
filter cutoff frequency.

513
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:25,100
And, so, let's do that now.

514
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:29,070
Again a 0 to 10 kilohertz
sweep range, but a 40

515
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,355
kilohertz sampling frequency.

516
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:38,560
And we should observe that the
filter cutoff frequency has

517
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,574
now doubled out to
four kilohertz.

518
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:47,889
Now, let's begin to decrease the
filter sampling frequency.

519
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:50,110
So from 40, let's change
the sampling

520
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:52,730
frequency to 20 kilohertz.

521
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:55,489
We should see the cutoff
frequency cut in half.

522
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,710
Now, we can go even further.

523
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:08,810
We can cut the sampling

524
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:10,650
frequency down to 10 kilohertz.

525
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,800
And remember that the sweep
range is 0 to 10 kilohertz.

526
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,080
So now we'll be sweeping
from 0 to 2 pi.

527
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:29,240
So as we get close to 2 pi,
we'll see the passband again.

528
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:33,040
And, now, let's cut down the
sampling frequency even

529
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,965
further, to 5 kilohertz.

530
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:42,240
Here we are at 2 pi.

531
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,830
And then at 4pi.

532
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:52,110
All right, so, that illustrates
the effect of

533
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:54,610
changing the sampling
frequency.

534
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:57,920
Now let's conclude this
demonstration of the effect of

535
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,180
the sampling frequency on the
filter cutoff frequency by

536
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:04,810
carrying out some filtering
on some live audio.

537
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:09,870
What we'll watch, in this case,
is the output audio

538
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:15,220
waveform as a function of time
on the single tray scope, and

539
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:18,220
also we'll listen
to the output.

540
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:21,870
We'll begin it with a 40
kilohertz sampling rate, then

541
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:23,870
reduce that to 20 kilohertz, 10

542
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:26,100
kilohertz, and then 5 kilohertz.

543
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,040
And in each of those cases, the
effective filter cutoff

544
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:33,130
frequency, then, is cut in half
from 4 kilohertz, to 2

545
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:37,080
kilohertz, to 1 kilohertz,
and then to 500 cycles.

546
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:40,120
So let's begin with a 40
kilohertz sampling frequency,

547
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:43,375
or an effective filter cutoff
frequency of 4 kilohertz.

548
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:54,090
Now, let's reduce that a 20
kilohertz sampling frequency,

549
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:55,340
or a 2 kilohertz filter.

550
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:02,655
Then a 10 kilohertz sampling
frequency.

551
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:11,130
And, finally, a 5 kilohertz
sampling frequency

552
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:15,615
corresponding to a 500 cycle
equivalent analog filter.

553
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:24,760
Alright, now, let's finally
conclude by returning to a

554
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,916
little higher quality ragtime
by changing the sampling

555
00:37:27,916 --> 00:37:30,406
frequency back to
40 kilohertz.

556
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,700
Alright, well, hopefully
what you've seen in the

557
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:46,775
demonstration and in this
lecture gives you a sense and

558
00:37:46,775 --> 00:37:52,780
a feeling for the analysis and
the use of discreet-time

559
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:56,160
filters for processing
continuous-time signals.

560
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,480
And as you may be aware, and
as I've tried to indicate

561
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,020
previously in the past, this,
in fact, is one very

562
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:08,670
important-- but not the only--
but one very important context

563
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:12,000
in which discreet-time
filtering is used.

564
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,480
And this, in fact, is an area
that is developing rapidly

565
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,800
because of the fact that
microprocessors, digital

566
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:25,100
technology, computers, et cetera
afford considerable

567
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:30,710
flexibility in carrying out
digital processing of signals.

568
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:37,540
And when digital processing
is used, that naturally

569
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:44,190
corresponds to implementing the
processing and analyzing

570
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,440
it in discreet-time.

571
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:52,120
Now, in the next lecture
we'll be

572
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,980
continuing on another aspect--

573
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,460
developing another aspect--

574
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,400
of sampling.

575
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,550
And, in particular, what we'll
be talking about is sampling

576
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:04,760
of discreet-time signals.

577
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:08,440
As I'll indicate there, one
of the contexts in which

578
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,890
discreet-time sampling, in fact,
plays an important role

579
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:18,180
is in the context in which we
are processing continuous-time

580
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:21,170
signals using discreet-time
processing.

581
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:24,510
Where, in fact, one step that
we might want to take-- in

582
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:27,130
addition to the steps so we've
talked about here--

583
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:31,470
is an additional sampling
process following whatever

584
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:33,770
kinds of filtering that we do.

585
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:36,650
Well, that's a discussion and
a topic that we'll be going

586
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:37,930
into in the next lecture.

587
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:39,180
Thank you.
