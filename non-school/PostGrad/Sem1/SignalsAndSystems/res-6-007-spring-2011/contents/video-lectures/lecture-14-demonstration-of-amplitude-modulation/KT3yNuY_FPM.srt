8
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,990
PROFESSOR: Well, today, we have
a chance to put away the

9
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,970
equations and have some fun.

10
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,370
With me is Professor Sandy Hill
from the University of

11
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:13,970
Massachusetts at Amherst.

12
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,870
And Sandy, maybe you could just
give us a quick tour of

13
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:18,860
what we have here.

14
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:19,590
SANDY HILL: OK.

15
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,070
We'll be dealing with about
four instruments today.

16
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,800
Two of them generate signals,
and two of them display and

17
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,400
analyze signals.

18
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,180
The first, and perhaps simplest,
is simply an RC

19
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,440
audio generator, that will put
out a variety wave shapes.

20
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,510
And we'll look at that
in a moment.

21
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,340
Over to the right is a device
that will allow us to study

22
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,590
amplitude modulation and the
various flavors of it.

23
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,950
Down below is a standard
oscilloscope to look at the

24
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,850
signals in the time domain so
we can see their shape.

25
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,790
And then, finally the spectrum
analyzer will analyze the

26
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,750
signal into its Fourier
components.

27
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,250
And we'll display those, so you
get to see the spectral

28
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,650
content of a signal.

29
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,490
PROFESSOR: Now, we'll be seeing
all of these in a fair

30
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:04,760
amount of detail as we go
through the demonstrations.

31
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,770
But maybe we can begin just
with the signal generator.

32
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,030
SANDY HILL: OK, let's
look quickly at the

33
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,390
various buttons involved.

34
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,730
There's a lot of flexibility
with this device.

35
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,590
The top three buttons here allow
us to change from one

36
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,530
simple wave form to another one,
a sine wave, a triangle

37
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,330
wave, a square wave.

38
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:26,490
And right below it is a button
that will allow us to change

39
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,390
the size of the signal.

40
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:32,290
Moving over towards the left,
we can change the DC offset

41
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:36,790
which varies the signal,
the level upon

42
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,550
which the signal rides.

43
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,390
PROFESSOR: And we'll be using
that actually when we

44
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,090
demonstrate amplitude
modulation.

45
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,540
SANDY HILL: That's right And
then finally, there's a way of

46
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,350
changing the frequency of the
signal, either changing it by

47
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,770
a factor of 10 or a vernier
adjustment, if you want very

48
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,850
specific adjustments, very
delicate changes.

49
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:54,190
PROFESSOR: OK.

50
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:58,090
So maybe we can just vary some
of this and see what a little

51
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,040
bit of it looks like.

52
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,870
SANDY HILL: All right.

53
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:04,130
What we have displayed at this
point is the effect of pushing

54
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,300
the sine wave button.

55
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,060
And so displayed down here
is a 500 Hertz sine wave.

56
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,240
In fact, let's listen to that.

57
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,490
PROFESSOR: Great.

58
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,790
SANDY HILL: And the scope is
said to have one millisecond

59
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,260
for each division here.

60
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,900
By varying the amplitude
knob can make the sine

61
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,410
wave smaller or larger.

62
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:26,010
The ear isn't too sensitive
to that.

63
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,400
By changing the DC offset,
it simply rides

64
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,515
on a different level.

65
00:03:29,515 --> 00:03:32,260
It's like putting a
battery in series.

66
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:36,360
And changing the frequency,
you get a very perceptible

67
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,230
change, a lower frequency.

68
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,570
It takes longer to sweep
through a period.

69
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:44,256
Higher frequency, it takes
a shorter amount of time.

70
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:48,060
And also, we can change the wave
shape itself from a sine

71
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,890
wave to a triangle wave--

72
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:54,840
and you notice that has
a richer sound to it--

73
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,210
and then finally to a square
wave, which is an even

74
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,510
brighter sound.

75
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:04,640
PROFESSOR: And actually, as you
realize from the previous

76
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,980
lectures, with the triangle and
square wave with the same

77
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,740
fundamental as the sine wave,
the richness comes in because

78
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:17,880
of the higher harmonics in the
Fourier series representation.

79
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,790
OK, well let's go back
to the sine wave.

80
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:23,770
And we'll use that to take
a closer look at

81
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,190
the spectrum analyzer.

82
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:25,720
SANDY HILL: OK.

83
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,140
PROFESSOR: We'll look at a block
diagram of the spectrum

84
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:32,190
analyzer shortly, but first
let's just look at a few quick

85
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,360
things to get a feel for it.

86
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,970
We have, of course,
the time domain

87
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,890
display of the sine wave.

88
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:44,230
And the spectrum analyzer gives
us a frequency domain

89
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,450
analysis and display.

90
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:52,540
And the vertical axis
is the amplitude.

91
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,070
The horizontal axis
is frequency.

92
00:04:55,070 --> 00:05:00,150
And as it's set currently, the
frequency axis goes from DC--

93
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,150
zero--

94
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,480
up to 2 kilohertz.

95
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,620
And that, of course,
can be varied on

96
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,950
the spectrum analyzer.

97
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:10,120
And since we have a sine wave
input, we get, as we would

98
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,820
expect, a line spectrum,
corresponding to the frequency

99
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,160
of the sine wave.

100
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,970
Now, in fact, we can measure
that frequency because the

101
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:23,840
spectrum analyzer has a cursor
associated with it, which I've

102
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,600
just enabled.

103
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,900
And this line is the
cursor line.

104
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,480
There is a read out for the
frequency and a read out for

105
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,500
the amplitude.

106
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,390
And let's position
the cursor on the

107
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:40,320
frequency of the sine wave.

108
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,520
And we're getting close.

109
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:49,530
And there we are at the
frequency of the sine wave.

110
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:53,350
And we can read out, in fact,
that it's 500 cycles.

111
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,260
And this is the amplitude.

112
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,910
And, of course, you could verify
the frequency also in

113
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:01,900
the time domain display,
simply by measuring the

114
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,690
frequency or the period.

115
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:08,310
SANDY HILL: This is set at
still one millisecond per

116
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:08,940
centimeter.

117
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,330
So that is 500 Hertz.

118
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,640
PROFESSOR: OK.

119
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:16,330
Well now maybe what we can
do is vary the frequency.

120
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,950
Let's vary the frequency of
the sine wave generator.

121
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,030
Maybe also listen to it?

122
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,110
SANDY HILL: I'll turn
on the tone.

123
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,130
Yep.

124
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,550
OK, I'll make the frequency
higher.

125
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,330
And you'll see a

126
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:28,810
correspondence in the time domain.

127
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:33,040
The frequency clearly goes up,
and that line of the spectrum

128
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,560
also migrates up away
from the cursor.

129
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,690
PROFESSOR: OK, and let me just
point out again that this is

130
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:38,610
the cursor line.

131
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,680
This isn't the spectra line.

132
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:46,560
And this is the frequency
content of the sine wave.

133
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,230
SANDY HILL: We can also change
the amplitude of that line by

134
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:53,240
making the sine wave
itself smaller.

135
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,880
And you notice the intensity
of it goes--

136
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,420
PROFESSOR: While you do that,
let me just position the

137
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:01,790
cursor if I can on
the sine wave.

138
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:04,880
And now as you vary the
amplitude, we should, in fact,

139
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,685
see this vary.

140
00:07:08,685 --> 00:07:10,641
SANDY HILL: Well,
that's right.

141
00:07:10,641 --> 00:07:11,130
PROFESSOR: OK.

142
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:15,460
Now as Sandy varied the
frequency, he did it slowly

143
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:19,590
and we saw the line move
as a single line.

144
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,500
Maybe now, Sandy, you
could vary the

145
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,970
frequency more rapidly.

146
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:29,583
And what will happen is that, in
fact, what we'll get if I--

147
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,865
SANDY HILL: There'll be
a spreading as we go--

148
00:07:31,865 --> 00:07:33,430
PROFESSOR: Let me turn
the cursor off.

149
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:37,870
And what we'll see is a
spreading of the line, so that

150
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,840
the frequency content
is richer.

151
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,770
And, in fact, the analysis of
this is considerably more

152
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:43,560
complicated.

153
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,050
It corresponds to frequency
modulation, where Sandy is now

154
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,175
the modulating signal.

155
00:07:49,175 --> 00:07:49,910
SANDY HILL: That's right.

156
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:53,890
PROFESSOR: And we won't really
be going into issues of

157
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:57,870
frequency modulation in any
more detail in this

158
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:58,710
demonstration.

159
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,670
SANDY HILL: Right.

160
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:03,240
PROFESSOR: OK, well now let's
go to the overhead projector

161
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,460
and take a look at a
block diagram of

162
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,710
the spectrum analyzer.

163
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:14,040
The specific spectrum analyzer
that we're using in the

164
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,420
demonstration is made by
Rockland Systems, referred to

165
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:22,320
as the Rockland Systems
Model FFT 512.

166
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:29,980
And basically, the idea is to
sample the incoming wave form,

167
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:33,919
convert that into digital form,
and then the spectrum,

168
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,929
in fact, is computed digitally
using a microprocessor.

169
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:45,330
So the overall system block
diagram first consists of a

170
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:48,280
system which is a
low pass filter.

171
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:54,100
And this low pass filter is
used in advance of the

172
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:59,580
sampling process to basically
reduce the artifacts that are

173
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,470
introduced due to sampling.

174
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:05,490
And although we haven't talked
yet about sampling and the

175
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:09,200
associated artifacts, basically,
as we'll see in the

176
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,480
upcoming lectures, in order to
sample a wave form and convert

177
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,870
it into digital form, it
requires that the wave form

178
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,990
first be low pass filtered.

179
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:24,440
So this low pass filter is
referred to-- and will be in

180
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,280
later lectures--

181
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,800
as an anti-aliasing filter.

182
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,840
And this low pass filtered wave
form is then converted to

183
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,750
a sequence.

184
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:39,730
And so a sequence is generated
for which the sequence values

185
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:46,590
are simply samples of the
low pass filtered input.

186
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:50,620
This low pass filtered
input is then put

187
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,340
into digital memory.

188
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:56,730
Basically, a time block of it
is put into digital memory,

189
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,620
and so that's what we
have down here.

190
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,340
Here is the sequence.

191
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:06,520
The sequence is put into
digital memory.

192
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:11,470
And then an arithmetic processor
computes for the

193
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,770
samples in this memory.

194
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:18,430
It computes the Fourier
transform or the spectrum.

195
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:22,810
And after the spectrum is
computed and put either into

196
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:26,860
the same or a different memory,
that is then put

197
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:31,560
through a conversion process
back to a continuous time

198
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:37,210
signal, and finally, put out on
the display that we've been

199
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:39,000
seeing in the demonstration.

200
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,190
And so this is just indicative
of the display.

201
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:46,900
So basically, the idea then
is that the input

202
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,410
wave form comes in.

203
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:53,950
It's filtered and sampled and
captured on a block basis, put

204
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:58,480
into a digital memory, and then,
a digital computer or

205
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,250
microprocessor computes
the Fourier transform.

206
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,530
And then that Fourier transform
is what we see on

207
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,930
the display.

208
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:10,840
So what we're computing, of
course, are samples of the

209
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,830
Fourier transform.

210
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:16,040
And so, for example, if the
input-- let's say--

211
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:20,680
was a rectangular pulse whose
Fourier transform is of the

212
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,030
form of a sine(x) over x
function, what we would, in

213
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:28,700
fact, see on the display are
samples of that at discrete

214
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,900
frequencies.

215
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:36,140
Or if as we have an input which
is a square wave, what

216
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:40,560
will generate through the
spectrum analyzer are the

217
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,760
Fourier series coefficients or
equivalently, the harmonics

218
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,720
associated with the
square wave.

219
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,950
OK, well, let's now go back to
the equipment and look at the

220
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,200
spectrum analyzer.

221
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,640
We'll look at the square wave
through the spectrum analyzer

222
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:06,040
shortly, but first what we have
is what we saw before,

223
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,920
which is the sine wave.

224
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,450
And just to point out, again,
the fact that the sine wave

225
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:16,550
spectrum, of course, is just a
single line corresponding to

226
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:19,080
the fundamental frequency.

227
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:24,070
And here we have a frequency
scale now that goes from 0 to

228
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,640
5 kilohertz.

229
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:29,680
And this is then the 500
cycle sine wave.

230
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:35,240
And, in fact, we can flip the
cursor on and I happen to just

231
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,110
magically have it positioned
correctly.

232
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:41,530
And we see that it's a
500 cycle sine wave.

233
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,030
SANDY HILL: Might be
interesting, Al, to go and

234
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,770
look at a richer set of signals,
such as the triangle

235
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:48,730
wave and the square wave--
things that are conveniently

236
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,650
on the signal generator
itself.

237
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:54,000
I'll switch over to
a square wave now.

238
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,340
And what you see is
all the harmonics

239
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:00,064
coming up, being displayed.

240
00:13:00,064 --> 00:13:02,460
PROFESSOR: OK, it's actually
interesting to point out, I

241
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:07,460
think, that the square wave,
as we know, is an

242
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,940
odd harmonic function.

243
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:14,470
And so, in fact, the even
harmonics are missing in the

244
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,220
square wave.

245
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,030
So this is the fundamental.

246
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:20,320
This is the third harmonic,
fifth harmonic, et cetera.

247
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,940
And then the amplitude of
the square wave decays

248
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,870
proportional to 1 over f, which
is the kind of analysis

249
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:30,000
that we've gone through in
looking at Fourier series.

250
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,150
SANDY HILL: Right, and if we
switch to the triangle wave,

251
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:36,730
instead of their decaying as 1
over f, the harmonics decay as

252
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:37,800
1 over f squared.

253
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,980
And you see they drop off
much more quickly.

254
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,310
PROFESSOR: And again,
of course, it's an

255
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:43,020
odd harmonic signal.

256
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:47,730
And so the even numbered
harmonics are missing.

257
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:52,450
And maybe just to kind of
emphasize the point, we can

258
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:55,720
show the sine wave again and
the square wave again.

259
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,360
SANDY HILL: We'll go through
from the most bland to the

260
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,510
richer to the richest.

261
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,750
PROFESSOR: OK, and it's
really kind of

262
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,750
interesting and dramatic--

263
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,650
SANDY HILL: It's
fun to do that.

264
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,130
PROFESSOR: --to see the
harmonics pop in.

265
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:07,900
SANDY HILL: While we're at the
square wave, let me fiddle

266
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,100
with the frequency of the square
wave, and we can see

267
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,970
the duality of the time
and frequency domains.

268
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:16,480
That is, as you compress things
in the time domain,

269
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,920
such as this, going to a higher
frequency square wave,

270
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,620
the harmonics wonder further
away from each other.

271
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,950
SANDY HILL: So this is
the fundamental.

272
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:28,810
The second harmonic
is missing.

273
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:30,290
This is the third harmonic.

274
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:31,730
And of course, the fifth.

275
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:34,290
SANDY HILL: And as we take this
to an extreme by going to

276
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,500
very low repetition rate
square waves, all those

277
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:43,370
harmonics come scurrying in and
cluster together near DC.

278
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:45,265
PROFESSOR: Kind of fun with
Fourier transforms.

279
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:53,170
Well, speaking of time and
frequency scaling, recall that

280
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:57,280
we had demonstrated time and
frequency scaling previously

281
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,880
with the glockenspiel.

282
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,840
And what we had done there was
to record a particular

283
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:08,110
glockenspiel note, and
then we played that

284
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,870
back at half speed.

285
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:14,880
And what we had done in that
case is expanded things in

286
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,740
time, consequently compress
them in frequency.

287
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:24,800
And so, comparing that with a
note an octave lower than we

288
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,340
saw that, in fact, the
time scaling had led

289
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,010
to a frequency scaling.

290
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:33,330
And then we also played the same
note back at twice speed.

291
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:36,120
And in that case, the
frequencies were all scaled up

292
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,010
by a factor of 2.

293
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:40,800
And again, we illustrated that
by comparing with the

294
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,660
glockenspiel note a
full octave up.

295
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,890
Now when we did that, we didn't
actually look at the

296
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:49,600
time wave forms or spectra.

297
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,230
And having the equipment that we
have here gives us kind of

298
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,420
a nice opportunity to do that.

299
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:59,110
So what I have is the tape that
we had originally made of

300
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:01,810
the glockenspiel, the original
note that we recorded.

301
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:05,670
And what we'll do is look at the
spectrum of that, and then

302
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:10,560
compare that spectrum when we
play the tape at half speed

303
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,540
and also play it
at twice speed.

304
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,240
So let's play the tape.

305
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:22,160
And what we have is the
glockenspiel right now

306
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,540
displayed on a frequency scale
from 0 to 5 kilohertz.

307
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:31,210
Let's just change that to
zero to 10 kilohertz.

308
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:33,620
So here is this spectrum.

309
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,950
Over here we have the
time wave form.

310
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:40,740
And here is then the first
spectral line, and we can see

311
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,710
where that is by setting
up the cursor.

312
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:48,290
And magically, once again, I
have the cursor positioned at

313
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:49,650
just the right spot.

314
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:55,120
The first spectral line
is at 1.775 kilohertz.

315
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,590
And so this is the spectrum
then of the original

316
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,881
glockenspiel note.

317
00:17:02,881 --> 00:17:03,320
All right.

318
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:07,890
Let's stop the tape
and rewind it.

319
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:13,660
And now what we want to do is
play that back at half speed.

320
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,849
Played at half speed,
the frequencies

321
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:18,599
should be scaled down.

322
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:22,560
And, in particular then the
first spectra line should be

323
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,760
at a lower frequency.

324
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,730
So let's play that now.

325
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:29,320
SANDY HILL: There are really
very complicated signals,

326
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,200
aren't they?

327
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,760
PROFESSOR: They really are.

328
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:37,580
Here we have the first
spectral line.

329
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:41,690
And we can compare that with the
first spectral line that

330
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:46,570
we had before which was
at 1.775 kilohertz.

331
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:51,030
And, once again, you see that
the time wave form over here

332
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:55,800
has been scaled by
a factor of 2.

333
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,210
So, once again, we see that
time and frequency scaling

334
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,820
really works.

335
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:05,340
Incidentally as Sandy pointed
out, and rightfully so, the

336
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:10,200
glockenspiel really is a pretty
complicated signal, as

337
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,870
a graduate student and I found
out when we were preparing the

338
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:16,120
original glockenspiel demo.

339
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,380
SANDY HILL: Speaking of
complicated signals, one of my

340
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,760
favorites is to look
at speech.

341
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,810
I set this up so that what's
coming into my microphone is

342
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:26,780
indeed what you're going to
see on the two screens.

343
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,660
The telephone company thinks of
speech, basically in terms

344
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,100
of bandwidth, that it extends
from about 300

345
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,930
Hertz to 3,300 Hertz.

346
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:35,880
But, as we'll see in the
spectrum analyzer, there's a

347
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,720
lot of leakage outside
of that.

348
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,860
The telephone company just
filters out everything outside

349
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,130
of that and things of that
as a speech signal.

350
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:46,220
So it doesn't have the high
fidelity that you might have

351
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,630
on high fire equipment.

352
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:51,800
As we look at the scope, again,
the time wave form is

353
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,460
extremely complicated, seems to
have some periodicities in

354
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,670
it, although they're
short-lived, and then it goes

355
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,120
on to some other
periodic chunk.

356
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,950
And over in the frequency
domain, you can see as we

357
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:08,020
extend from 0 to 10 kilohertz,
that as I speak, there are

358
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:11,750
trenchants that have spectral
content in them, covering that

359
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,990
entire band.

360
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,460
I can try some simpler
signals.

361
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,550
A whistle is almost a sinusoid,
but as you'll see

362
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,170
isn't terribly sinusoidal.

[HIGH-PITCHED WHISTLE]

embarrassedly, a B,

PROFESSOR: They don't
ask me to, Sandy.

369
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,440
SANDY HILL: And then different
vowel sounds have a lot of

370
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,280
energy in, like the letter A.
(SUNG) A. Whereas some of the

371
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,800
others are very impulsive,
like--

[HISSING]

Or puh and tuh.

374
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:48,160
And it's a little hard to grab
them at the right time.

375
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,390
But what's fascinating is just
to stare at equipment like

376
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,410
this and try different speech
sounds, and you begin to get

377
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:58,300
sort of a sense of the
complicated nature of them.

378
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:02,040
PROFESSOR: OK, well that's a
look at some spectra signals.

379
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:08,780
And now what we'd like to focus
on is the modulator and

380
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:12,215
talk a little bit about
modulation and demodulation

381
00:20:12,215 --> 00:20:13,800
and demonstrate it.

382
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:18,510
And let's begin that by first
taking a look at a block

383
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,940
diagram of the modulator
system.

384
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:27,260
Well, as we've discussed in a
previous lecture, amplitude

385
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:32,790
modulation basically consists of
multiplying the modulating

386
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:36,900
signal by an appropriate
carrier, illustrated here, as

387
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:41,870
we've seen previously, for the
case of a sinusoidal carrier.

388
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:45,930
And then, specifically for
sinusoidal amplitude

389
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:51,580
modulation, we may or may not
inject some carrier signal--

390
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,660
A times the carrier.

391
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:59,610
Or equivalently, if we look at
the modulated output, the

392
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:03,800
injection of the carrier is
equivalent, mathematically, to

393
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,310
simply adding a DC offset
or a constant to

394
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,250
the modulating signal.

395
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:14,490
And, as you recall when we
talked about this, the idea of

396
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:19,310
injecting a carrier or not is
related to the issue of

397
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:22,860
whether or not we want to do
synchronous or asynchronous

398
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,290
demodulation.

399
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:27,540
The asynchronous demodulation
corresponding to the simple

400
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:30,050
use of an envelope detector.

401
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:34,250
And to remind you of the wave
forms that are involved,

402
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:38,230
again, I show two that
we saw previously.

403
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:44,360
And for the case, this is for
one value of the amount of

404
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,720
carrier that's injected.

405
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,170
And this is for an amount of
carrier injected that's less.

406
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:54,560
And this, in fact, corresponds
to what we refer to as 50%

407
00:21:54,560 --> 00:22:00,020
modulation, and this is the
case of 100% modulation.

408
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:04,810
Well, the modulating system
that we're using in this

409
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:08,630
demonstration is basically
of the form that

410
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:10,160
we're indicating here.

411
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:16,020
And a simple block diagram for
it is more or less identical

412
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,820
to what we just saw.

413
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:22,400
Specifically, the modulating
signal is

414
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,010
multiplied by the carrier.

415
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:29,300
And there also is the capability
of injecting some

416
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:33,420
additional carrier, meaning
adding it to the output of

417
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,430
this product.

418
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:38,900
And so the modulated output can
have a variable percent

419
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,770
modulation--

420
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:44,000
the percent modulation being
changed, depending on how we

421
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,690
set this variable gain.

422
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:50,450
Now, in addition to sinusoidal
modulation--

423
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:53,980
in fact, for the particular
system that we're using, we

424
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,350
have somewhat more
flexibility.

425
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:59,340
We can use, in addition to a
sinusoidal carrier at this

426
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:04,640
point, we can alternatively
choose a square wave carrier

427
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,540
or a triangular carrier.

428
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:10,600
And, as we'll indicate in a
moment when we illustrate

429
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,280
this, there are some specific
advantages to using, for

430
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,300
example, a square
wave carrier.

431
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:21,890
So this is a somewhat simplified
version of--

432
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:26,730
or rather block diagram of the
modulating system that we're

433
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:27,950
demonstrating.

434
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:32,010
The external modulating input
here, a choice of carrier with

435
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:35,100
also the capability for
injecting some additional

436
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,350
carrier into the output.

437
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,490
OK, now let's go back
to the equipment and

438
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:42,100
take a look at this.

439
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,290
Well, Sandy, maybe to begin,
you can just point out what

440
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,800
some of the controls are
on the modulator box.

441
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,180
SANDY HILL: OK, there
are some interesting

442
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,230
points to look at here.

443
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:54,860
This is an input for
an external signal.

444
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,330
We'll be taking a signal right
out of the signal generator

445
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:58,670
and putting it in here.

446
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:01,960
And that will be the signal
that will be modulated,

447
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,560
according to the carrier.

448
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,450
The carrier is generated
internally in this device.

449
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:08,870
And there are several ways
of controlling it.

450
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:12,170
One is the amount of
carrier injection.

451
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:16,410
One is the wave form of the
carrier itself-- and this is

452
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:19,530
typically sinusoidal in the
broadcast industry, but others

453
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:21,710
are interesting to
look at as well.

454
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,110
The output that will be
displaying on both the

455
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:27,310
spectrum analyzer and scope
comes out here.

456
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:30,580
And then farther over to the
left, there are some knobs for

457
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:33,440
changing the frequency of
the carrier signal.

458
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,340
PROFESSOR: OK, let me also
just point out again for

459
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:40,780
emphasis that changing the
carrier level, as we've talked

460
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:43,800
about, is mathematically
equivalent to changing the DC

461
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,990
level of the modulating
signal.

462
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:49,545
And that's also what affects the
percent modulation as we

463
00:24:49,545 --> 00:24:51,320
had just discussed.

464
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:56,930
Now what we have set up is a
sinusoidal modulating signal

465
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:59,050
and a sinusoidal
little carrier.

466
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:04,120
And, as usual, we have the time
wave form displayed here.

467
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,840
And so this is the
modulated signal.

468
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:10,070
And then on the spectrum
analyzer, we have

469
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:11,870
the spectral display.

470
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:14,750
And this is the carrier
signal.

471
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,620
That's the carrier frequency.

472
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:21,070
And these side bands then
correspond to the side bands

473
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:23,270
associated with the
modulating signal.

474
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:27,730
So this is the spectrum of the
total modulated output, right?

475
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:28,480
SANDY HILL: Right.

476
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,990
It's interesting to vary some
of these parameters.

477
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:33,560
You can see the sinusoidal
modulating

478
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,970
shape at this point.

479
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:39,010
Let me switch that to
a triangular shape.

480
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:42,500
And, again, it's a little hard
to sink in both the modulating

481
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,150
signal and the carrier, so you
see the carrier kind of

482
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:47,630
wondering by, but there it is.

483
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,950
Another thing that can be varied
is the amplitude of the

484
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:50,950
modulating signal.

485
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,280
I'll make it smaller--

486
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,960
you'll see the side
bands go away--

487
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,070
until finally we have a pure
sinusoidal carrier--

488
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:00,040
as I bring them back in.

489
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,440
Again, this is triangular.

490
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,160
There would be harmonics there
that maybe they're a little

491
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,560
hard to see in the spectrum
analyzer.

492
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:10,570
I'll go back first to a square
wave modulating signal, which

493
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:14,630
is, again, you can see the
square wave on top and one on

494
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:15,740
the bottom.

495
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,480
PROFESSOR: And so all of this,
then, represents side bands.

496
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,050
Is that--

497
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:19,330
SANDY HILL: That's right.

498
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:23,450
Those are the side bands due to
the square wave modulation.

499
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:26,130
Going back to the simplest,
the sinusoidal carrier.

500
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:30,330
Another thing we can do is to
vary the frequency of the

501
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:32,790
sinusoidal signal that's
modulating it.

502
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,890
I'll make it higher.

503
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:37,650
And you'll notice that the side
bands wander away from

504
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:40,230
the carrier signal
in the spectrum.

505
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:43,130
The spectrum, the carrier signal
of that, doesn't have a

506
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:46,040
frequency that's changing
as I do this.

507
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,900
It's just the width of
the band, due to

508
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:49,990
the modulating signal.

509
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:51,350
PROFESSOR: So this
is the carrier.

510
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,740
And these are the side bands.

511
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,280
SANDY HILL: That's right.

512
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,570
Now as we go out very far, those
side bands get gobbled

513
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:58,215
up by the carrier itself.

514
00:26:58,215 --> 00:27:01,510
I'll come back to a nice
reasonable point there.

515
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:09,060
PROFESSOR: OK, now, we can
change also the carrier

516
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:13,790
frequency and, as Sandy's
indicated, various parameters.

517
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:17,690
Now let me just point out, since
I didn't previously,

518
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:21,380
that the frequency scale that
we're looking at here is a

519
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:24,790
frequency scale out
to 20 kilohertz.

520
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:28,770
And we had talked about--
or Sandy had indicated--

521
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:33,210
that we can change the
carrier signal shape.

522
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:38,550
And let me change the carrier
signal from a sine wave to a

523
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:39,970
square wave.

524
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:43,190
Now you haven't seen any change
on this particular

525
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:47,680
display , but let me change
the frequency scale.

526
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:54,060
And what you see now is the
modulating signal showing up

527
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:58,090
around harmonics associated
with the carrier.

528
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:03,100
And those harmonics will go
away when we go back to a

529
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,630
sinusoidal carrier.

530
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:06,300
SANDY HILL: This is actually
called a ring modulator.

531
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:09,600
It's very simple to multiply
a signal by a square wave.

532
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,220
It's just a chopping process.

533
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,770
And so a square wave carrier
signal is very

534
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:15,380
convenient to generate.

535
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:19,676
And then you simply filter out
the higher order harmonics.

536
00:28:19,676 --> 00:28:21,660
PROFESSOR: Right, I'll
go back to the

537
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,850
scale that we had before.

538
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:28,160
And Sandy had also commented
that we can

539
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,190
change the carrier level.

540
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:33,870
And let's do that on
the modulator box.

541
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:38,140
We could do that either by
changing a DC offset on the

542
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,700
modulating signal or by changing
the amount of carrier

543
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,950
that's injected.

544
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:46,170
And as we decrease the amount
of carrier, in fact, going

545
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:49,550
down to no carrier at all
or almost no carrier.

546
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:51,280
That's suppressed carrier.

547
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:55,340
We have only the two side bands
and the signal is now

548
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:58,320
highly over-modulated.

549
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:05,390
We bring the carrier back up and
when we do that, then we

550
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:11,350
are reducing the percent
modulation and simultaneously

551
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:15,420
obviously related to that is
changing the carrier level.

552
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:21,230
Now I had indicated in previous
lectures that

553
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:24,270
reducing the carrier is
efficient in terms of power

554
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:30,250
transmission, but requires a
synchronous demodulator,

555
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:34,730
whereas if there's carrier
injected, as we have here, so

556
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:36,200
that we're not over-modulating--

557
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,700
the percent modulation
is less than 100--

558
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:42,180
then because of the shape of the
time wave form, as you can

559
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:47,480
see here, you can do the
demodulation with a more or

560
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,520
less simple envelope detector.

561
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:54,500
And in fact, a envelope detector
of the type that

562
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,720
we've talked about before is
exactly what is used in AM

563
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:01,560
radios, because of the fact
that it's so inexpensive.

564
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:05,650
And so here the power
transmitted required is

565
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:09,800
higher, but the demodulator,
based on using an envelope

566
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,280
detector, is considerably
simpler.

567
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:18,900
Well, speaking of AM radios,
what we'd like to now

568
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:24,030
demonstrate is modulation and
demodulation with an AM radio,

569
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:27,710
which Sandy happens
to have here.

570
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:31,670
And let's see, I guess, what
you're going to do, Sandy, is

571
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:32,815
take it apart for us, right?

572
00:30:32,815 --> 00:30:33,070
SANDY HILL: Right.

573
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,930
I've taken off the back.

574
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:39,260
And I'm just now going to slip
out the guts of it all, and

575
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:42,940
try and set it up so you can see
it conveniently, such as

576
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,846
right there.

577
00:30:44,846 --> 00:30:47,140
PROFESSOR: Now, this is your
daughter's radio that you

578
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:47,750
promised to give back.?

579
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:50,480
SANDY HILL: I would say was
my daughter's radio.

580
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,250
And now let's start attaching
clip leads, because what we're

581
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:56,480
going to want to do is to be
able to see the signals coming

582
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,580
out of the radio.

583
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:00,890
We want to see both the audio
and then the modulated signal

584
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:02,800
and try and see them on
the oscilloscope.

585
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,005
So I'll start setting
that up now.

586
00:31:05,005 --> 00:31:05,700
PROFESSOR: OK.

587
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,760
Let me--

588
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:11,220
while you're doing that-- also
just comment that the kind of

589
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,790
AM radio that we're looking
at here is called a

590
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,350
superheterodyne receiver.

591
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:19,380
And the way that it does the
demodulation is not exactly

592
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,950
the way we've talked about
it in the lectures.

593
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,320
It's very close.

594
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,770
The idea is this the RF signal,
the radio frequency

595
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:29,790
signal, first gets modulated
down to what's called an IF

596
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:32,320
stage-- the intermediate
frequency stage.

597
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,840
And then it's that signal that
goes to an envelope detector

598
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,280
of the type we've talked
about to generate

599
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,930
the demodulated signal.

600
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:45,900
So, I guess what Sandy has
some probes on are the RF

601
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,540
input and a ground--

602
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,260
SANDY HILL: That's right.

603
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,960
The red lead here is a ground.

604
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,650
It's common for both the signals
we'll be looking at.

605
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:54,520
This is at the audio.

606
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,660
We're actually looking at the
signal going directly into the

607
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,720
speaker across these
two leads.

608
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,810
And then this probe down here,
which I found by hunting and

609
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:05,740
pecking, is the IF signal, the
intermediate frequency signal,

610
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:08,490
with a station on it that I'll
now try and get something that

611
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:09,380
sounds reasonable.

612
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:12,146
[RADIO FEEDBACK]

613
00:32:12,146 --> 00:32:12,610
SANDY HILL: OK.

614
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:13,710
A little sports.

615
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:15,755
PROFESSOR: Never quite know what
you're going to get when

616
00:32:15,755 --> 00:32:16,910
you turn this on.

617
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:18,160
SANDY HILL: That's
right, you don't.

618
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,960
Make some adjustments there.

619
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:27,500
And what you can see right
here is the audio signal.

620
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:31,480
I'll give it a little
bit more game.

621
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,510
And this is the actual
intermediate frequency,

622
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:36,380
modulated by the audio.

623
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:39,010
And there's a correspondence
between them that goes by

624
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:42,180
awfully fast, but I think it's
pretty simple to see.

625
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:45,550
PROFESSOR: So basically the top
trace is the envelope of

626
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:46,170
the bottom right.

627
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:47,000
SANDY HILL: That's right.

628
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,860
This is what comes out of
the envelope detector.

629
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,800
And this is the signal into the
envelope detector, in this

630
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,930
particular radio.

631
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:59,850
What I'd like to do for a last
experiment is what we've been

632
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:00,700
doing at this point--

633
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,470
I'll turn this off
for a moment--

634
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:05,190
is we're taking something that's
coming in over the

635
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:08,350
airwaves, as they used to say,
and we're simply viewing it.

636
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,690
What I'd like to do now is
generate our own radio

637
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:13,390
frequency signal, tune it
up so this radio is

638
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:15,160
going to hear it--

639
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,300
whatever that means--

640
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,710
and display it here.

641
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:23,170
What we're going to do then is
use the audio oscillator,

642
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:26,710
along with the amplitude
modulator.

643
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:30,060
And we're going to take from the
output now the lead here.

644
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,020
And this will act
as the antenna.

645
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:34,900
This device was not designed
to put out a lot of power.

646
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,550
But fortunately we don't have a
lot of distance to go over.

647
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:40,480
What I'm going to do is turn
myself into an antenna--

648
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,250
I'm basically 150 pounds
of salt water--

649
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:46,380
and when I touch this, the
signal coming in here, which

650
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:49,550
is radiating a little from the
wire, is going to suddenly

651
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:52,150
radiate from my whole body and
hopefully will be enough

652
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:53,450
to be picked up.

653
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:58,130
So what I'll do is I'm going
to turn this on--

654
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:59,800
excuse the noise.

655
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,850
Now I've set this up so it's
tuned to a particular radio

656
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:04,900
station, and I hope
I can find it now.

657
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:09,100
It takes a little fussing.

658
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:15,429
That's not it.

659
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,710
That sounds like it now.

660
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:22,210
OK.

661
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:25,929
PROFESSOR: So this gets billed
as Sandy Hill, human antenna.

662
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:27,580
SANDY HILL: That's right.

663
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:30,920
What you're looking at here is
I've got the antenna at this

664
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,630
point, and what we're going
to do is you're

665
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,110
seeing the audio signal.

666
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:37,980
This is coming from the signal
generator up here.

667
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:42,699
And this is the intermediate
frequency signal again.

668
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:45,389
You can hear it's much stronger
when my body becomes

669
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:47,250
the antenna.

670
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:48,909
And I'll leave it
on for a second.

671
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:51,872
And I can switch to
square wave--

672
00:34:51,872 --> 00:34:54,199
doesn't look much like
a square wave.

673
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:56,590
Various things.

674
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:59,780
There's significant distortion,
because of all the

675
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:02,290
transformations that the signal
is going through.

676
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:06,870
But it does indeed work, and
we're picking up a frequency

677
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:09,360
that the radio is tuned to.

678
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,170
And that's it.

679
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:13,590
PROFESSOR: So Sandy has
now been modulated and

680
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:14,080
demodulated.

681
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,280
SANDY HILL: That's right.

682
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,090
PROFESSOR: Well, hopefully, all
the things that we've gone

683
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:23,800
through in the process of this
tape and this set of

684
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,250
demonstrations gives you a feel
for at least some of the
