00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,620
PROFESSOR: Last time,
we talked about the

2
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,600
representation of linear
time-invariant systems through

3
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,400
the convolution sum in the
discrete-time case and the

4
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,120
convolution integral in the
continuous-time case.

5
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,520
Now, although the derivation
was relatively

6
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,970
straightforward, in fact, the
result is really kind of

7
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:06,250
amazing because what it tells
us is that for linear

8
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,580
time-invariant systems, if we
know the response of the

9
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:14,540
system to a single impulse at
t = 0, or in fact, at any

10
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:18,710
other time, then we can
determine from that its

11
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:22,590
response to an arbitrary input
through the use of

12
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,900
convolution.

13
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,650
Furthermore, what we'll see as
the course develops is that,

14
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,660
in fact, the class of linear
time-invariant systems is a

15
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,720
very rich class.

16
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,770
There are lots of systems
that have that property.

17
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:39,650
And in addition, there are
lots of very interesting

18
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:42,280
things that you can do with
linear time-invariant systems.

19
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:49,510
In today's lecture, what I'd
like to begin with is focusing

20
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:53,730
on convolution as an algebraic
operation.

21
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:57,370
And we'll see that it has a
number of algebraic properties

22
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:02,150
that in turn have important
implications for linear

23
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,120
time-invariant systems.

24
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:08,009
Then we'll turn to a discussion
of what the

25
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:11,680
characterization of linear
time-invariant systems through

26
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,900
convolution implies, in terms
of the relationship, of

27
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,110
various other system properties

28
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,240
to the impulse response.

29
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:26,220
Let me begin by reminding you
of the basic result that we

30
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:31,180
developed last time, which
is the convolution sum in

31
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:37,740
discrete time, as I indicate
here, and the convolution

32
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,820
integral in continuous time.

33
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:44,850
And what the convolution sum,
or the convolution integral,

34
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:51,850
tells us is how to relate the
output to the input and to the

35
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:53,940
system impulse response.

36
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:58,750
And the expression looks
basically the same in

37
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,320
continuous time and
discrete time.

38
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,650
And I remind you also that we
talked about a graphical

39
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:09,940
interpretation, where
essentially, to graphically

40
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:15,760
interpret convolution required,
or was developed, in

41
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,160
terms of taking the system
impulse response, flipping it,

42
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,460
sliding it past the input, and
positioned appropriately,

43
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:29,500
depending on the value of the
independent variable for which

44
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,340
we're computing the convolution,
and then

45
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,230
multiplying and summing in the
discrete-time case, or

46
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:38,390
integrating in the
continuous-time case.

47
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:47,070
Now convolution, as an algebraic
operation, has a

48
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:51,000
number of important
properties.

49
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,370
One of the properties of
convolution is that it is what

50
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:58,300
is referred to as commutative.

51
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:05,330
Commutative means that we can
think either of convolving x

52
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:11,760
with h, or h with x, and the
order in which that's done

53
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,590
doesn't affect the
output result.

54
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:19,649
So summarized here is what the
commutative operation is in

55
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:23,990
discrete time, or in
continuous time.

56
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:28,050
And it says, as I just
indicated, that x[n]

57
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,240
convolved with h[n]

58
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,500
is equal to h[n]

59
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,750
convolved with x[n].

60
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,930
Or the same, of course,
in continuous time.

61
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:44,200
And in fact, in the lecture
last time, we worked an

62
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,000
example where we had, in
discrete time, an impulse

63
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,980
response, which was an
exponential, and an input,

64
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,760
which is a unit step.

65
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,520
And in the text, what you'll
find is the same example

66
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,110
worked, except in that case, the
input is the exponential.

67
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:07,370
And the system impulse
response is the step.

68
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:11,380
And that corresponds to the
example in the text, which is

69
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:15,720
example 3.1.

70
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,130
And what happens in that example
is that, in fact, what

71
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:24,850
you'll see is that the same
result occurs in example 3.1

72
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:27,400
as we generated in
the lecture.

73
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,090
And there's a similar comparison
in continuous time.

74
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:34,680
This example was worked
in lecture.

75
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,740
And this example is worked
in the text.

76
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:43,370
In other words, the text works
the example where the system

77
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:47,960
impulse response
is a unit step.

78
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,130
And the input is
an exponential.

79
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:55,220
All right, now the commutative
property, as I said, tells us

80
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:59,700
that the order in which we do
convolution doesn't affect the

81
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,710
result of the convolution.

82
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,560
The same is true for
continuous time

83
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,940
and discrete time.

84
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,830
And in fact, for the other
algebraic properties that I'll

85
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:12,310
talk about, the results are
exactly the same for

86
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:15,040
continuous time and
discrete time.

87
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:22,210
So in fact, what we can do is
drop the independent variable

88
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:26,720
as an argument so that we
suppress any kind of

89
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,820
difference between continuous
and discrete time.

90
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:34,220
And suppressing the independent
variable, we then

91
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:39,170
state the commutative property
as I've rewritten it here.

92
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:42,970
Just x convolved with h equals
h convolved with x.

93
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:47,360
The same in continuous time
and discrete time.

94
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,950
Now, the derivation of the
commutative property is, more

95
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,900
or less, some algebra
which you can follow

96
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,960
through in the book.

97
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:01,810
It involves some changes
of variables and some

98
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,310
things of that sort.

99
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:08,440
What I'd like to focus on with
that and other properties is

100
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:12,520
not the derivation, which you
can see in the text, but

101
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,760
rather the interpretation.

102
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,050
So we have the commutative
property, and now there are

103
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:21,090
two other important algebraic
properties.

104
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:25,760
One being what is referred to
as the associative property,

105
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:32,590
which tells us that if we have x
convolved with the result of

106
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:37,570
convolving h1 with h2, that's
exactly the same as x

107
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:42,890
convolved with h1, and that
result convolved with h2.

108
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:49,590
And what this permits is for
us to write, for example, x

109
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:56,470
convolved with h1 convolved with
h2 without any ambiguity

110
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:00,750
because it doesn't matter from
the associative property how

111
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:04,470
we group the terms together.

112
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:07,950
The third important property is
what is referred to as the

113
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:11,670
distributive property, namely
the fact that convolution

114
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,520
distributes over addition.

115
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,560
And what I mean by that is what
I've indicated here on

116
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:24,650
the slide: that if I think of x
convolved with the sum of h1

117
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:31,380
and h2, that's identical to
first convolving x with h1,

118
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:37,140
also convolving x with h2, and
then adding the two together.

119
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,960
And that result will be the
same as this result.

120
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:47,550
So convolution is commutative,
associative, and it

121
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,050
distributes over addition.

122
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:52,080
Three very important algebraic
properties.

123
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,710
And by the way, there are other
algebraic operations

124
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,330
that have that same property.

125
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:02,900
For example, multiplication
of numbers is likewise

126
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:07,000
commutative, associative,
and distributive.

127
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,890
Now let's look at what these
three properties imply

128
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:15,170
specifically for linear
time-invariant systems.

129
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:19,770
And as we'll see, the
implications are both very

130
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:22,260
interesting and very
important.

131
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:26,910
Let's begin with the commutative
property.

132
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:32,860
And consider, in particular,
a system with an impulse

133
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,630
response h.

134
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:39,450
And I represent that by simply
writing the h inside the box.

135
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:46,100
An input x and an output,
then, which is x * h.

136
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,430
Now, since this operation is
commutative, I can write

137
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:55,020
instead of x * h, I
can write h * x.

138
00:09:55,020 --> 00:10:00,210
And that would correspond to a
system with impulse response

139
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:07,880
x, and input h, and
output then h * x.

140
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:13,620
So the commutative property
tells us that for a linear

141
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:20,040
time-invariant system, the
system output is independent

142
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:24,290
of which function we call the
input and which function we

143
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,830
call the impulse response.

144
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,360
Kind of amazing actually.

145
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,090
We can interchange the role of
input and impulse response.

146
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:36,480
And from an output point of
view, the output or the system

147
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,660
doesn't care.

148
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:44,100
Now furthermore, if we combine
the commutative property with

149
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,270
the associative property,
we get another

150
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,130
very interesting result.

151
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:52,020
Namely that if we have two
linear time-invariant systems

152
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:57,330
in cascade, the overall system
is independent of the order in

153
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,890
which they're cascaded.

154
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:02,740
And in fact, in either case, the
cascade can be collapsed

155
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,660
into a single system.

156
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:13,120
To see this, let's first
consider the cascade of two

157
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,140
systems, one with impulse
response h1, the other with

158
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,330
impulse response h2.

159
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:25,770
And the output of the first
system is then x * h1.

160
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:29,470
And then that is the input
to the second system.

161
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:36,920
And so the output of that is
that result convolved with h2.

162
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,500
So this is the result of
cascading the two.

163
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:45,190
And now we can use the
associative property to

164
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:55,000
rewrite this as x * (h1
* h2), where we group

165
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,160
these two terms together.

166
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,200
And so using the associative
property, we now can collapse

167
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,860
that into a single system with
an input, which is x, and

168
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,360
impulse response, which
is h1 * h2.

169
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,040
And the output is then x
convolved with the result of

170
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,880
those two convolved.

171
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,880
Next, we can apply the
commutative property.

172
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,590
And the commutative property
says we could write this

173
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:28,970
impulse response that way, or
we could write it this way.

174
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:32,200
And since convolution is
commutative, the resulting

175
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,100
output will be exactly
the same.

176
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:39,200
And so these resulting outputs
will be exactly the same.

177
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,560
And now, once again we can use
the associative property to

178
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,670
group these two terms
together.

179
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:54,920
And x * h2 corresponds to
putting x first through the

180
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:59,270
system h2 and then that output
through the system h1.

181
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:03,320
And so finally applying the
associative property again, as

182
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:08,330
I just outlined, we can expand
that system back into two

183
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:16,160
systems in cascade with h2
first and h1 second,

184
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,220
OK, well that involves a certain
amount of algebraic

185
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,490
manipulation.

186
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:24,620
And that is not the algebraic

187
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,140
manipulation that is important.

188
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,250
It's the result that
it's important.

189
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,330
And what the result says, to
reiterate, is if I have two

190
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:35,750
linear time-invariant systems in
cascade, I can cascade them

191
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,740
in any order, and the
result is the same.

192
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:43,630
Now you might think, well gee,
maybe that actually applies to

193
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:46,710
systems in general, whether
you put them

194
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,020
this way or that way.

195
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:52,140
But in fact, as we talked
about last time, and I

196
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:58,680
illustrated with an example, in
general, if the systems are

197
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,000
not linear and time-invariant,
then the order in which

198
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,490
they're cascaded is important
to the interpretation of the

199
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,690
overall system.

200
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:11,070
For example, if one system took
the square root and the

201
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:16,080
other system doubled the input,
taking the square root

202
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:20,320
and then doubling gives us a
different answer than doubling

203
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,150
first and then taking
the square root.

204
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:25,570
And of course, one can construct
much more elaborate

205
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,330
examples than that.

206
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:30,280
So it's a property very
particular to linear

207
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,570
time-invariant systems.

208
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:37,590
And also one that we will
exploit many, many times as we

209
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:40,900
go through this material.

210
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:45,440
The final property related to an
interconnection of systems

211
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,470
that I want to just indicate
develops out of the

212
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,270
distributive property.

213
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:55,320
And what it applies to is
an interpretation of the

214
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,020
interconnection of systems
in parallel.

215
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:03,520
Recall that the parallel
combination of systems

216
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:09,030
corresponds, as I indicate here,
to a system in which we

217
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:13,900
simultaneously feed the input
into h1 and h2, these

218
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,680
representing the impulse
responses.

219
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,410
And then, the outputs
are summed to

220
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:22,740
form the overall output.

221
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:28,050
And using the fact that
convolution distributes over

222
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:37,750
addition, we can rewrite
this as x * (h1 + h2).

223
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:41,980
And when we do that then, we
can recognize this as the

224
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:47,280
output of a system with input x
and impulse response, which

225
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,300
is the sum of these two
impulse responses.

226
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:55,240
So for linear time-invariant
systems in parallel, we can,

227
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:00,600
if we choose, replace that
interconnection by a single

228
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,920
system whose impulse response
is simply the sum of those

229
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,170
impulse responses.

230
00:16:09,854 --> 00:16:16,460
OK, now we have this very
powerful representation for

231
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:20,530
linear time-invariant systems
in terms of convolution.

232
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:25,010
And we've seen so far in this
lecture how convolution and

233
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:28,860
the representation through the
impulse response leads to some

234
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,570
important implications for
system interconnections.

235
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:39,100
What I'd like to turn to now
are other system properties

236
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:43,400
and see how, for linear
time-invariant systems in

237
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:49,490
particular, other system
properties can be associated

238
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:53,500
with particular properties or
characteristics of the system

239
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,160
impulse response.

240
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,130
And what we'll talk about are
a variety of properties.

241
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:01,200
We'll talk about the issue of
memory, we'll talk about the

242
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,780
issue of invertibility, and
we'll talk about the issue of

243
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:07,004
causality and also stability.

244
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:13,230
Well, let's begin with
the issue of memory.

245
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:18,660
And the question now is what are
the implications for the

246
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,490
system impulse response for a
linear time-invariant system?

247
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:25,440
Remember that we're always
imposing that on the system.

248
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,319
What are the implications on
the impulse response if the

249
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,350
system does or does
not have memory?

250
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:36,440
Well, we can answer
that by looking at

251
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,860
the convolution property.

252
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:43,660
And we have here, as a reminder,
the convolution

253
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:51,230
integral, which tells us how
x(tau) and h(t - tau) are

254
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:56,020
combined to give us y(t).

255
00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:00,940
And what I've illustrated
above is a

256
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,730
general kind of example.

257
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:04,890
Here is x(tau).

258
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:08,670
Here is h(t - tau).

259
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:13,450
And to compute the output at
any time t, we would take

260
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:18,160
these two, multiply them
together, and integrate from

261
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,730
-infinity to +infinity.

262
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:27,050
So the question then is what
can we say about h(t), the

263
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:33,020
impulse response in order to
guarantee, let's say, that the

264
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:37,090
output depends only on
the input at time t.

265
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:43,900
Well, it's pretty much obvious
from looking at the graphs.

266
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:51,740
If we only want the output to
depend on x(tau) at tau = t,

267
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:59,360
then h(t - tau) better be
non-zero only at tau = t.

268
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,990
And so the implication then is
that for the system to be

269
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:12,100
memoryless, what we require is
that h(t - tau) be non-zero

270
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:16,500
only at tau = t.

271
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,960
So we want the impulse response
to be non-zero at

272
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,230
only one point.

273
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,670
We want it to contribute
something after we multiply

274
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,490
and go through an integral.

275
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:29,410
And in effect, what that says is
the only thing that it can

276
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:30,680
be and meet all those

277
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,400
conditions is a scaled impulse.

278
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:39,310
So if the system is to be
memoryless, then that requires

279
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:43,020
that the impulse response
be a scaled impulse.

280
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:49,190
Any other impulse response then,
in essence, requires

281
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:52,010
that the system have memory,
or implies that the system

282
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:54,210
have memory.

283
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:59,950
So for the continuous-time case
then, memoryless would

284
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:03,760
correspond only to the impulse
response being proportional to

285
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,060
an impulse.

286
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:09,720
And in the discrete-time case,
a similar statement, in which

287
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,590
case, the output is just
proportional to the input,

288
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:17,730
again either in the
continuous-time or in the

289
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:18,980
discrete-time case.

290
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:22,670
All right.

291
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:27,650
Now we can turn our attention
to the issue of system

292
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:29,410
invertibility.

293
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:35,460
And recall that what is meant by
invertibility of a system,

294
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,690
or the inverse of a system.

295
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:41,080
The inverse of a system is a
system, which when we cascade

296
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:45,360
it with the one that we're
inquiring about, the overall

297
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,110
cascade is the identity
system.

298
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:53,370
In other words, the output
is equal to the input.

299
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:56,980
So let's consider a system
with impulse

300
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:00,440
response h, input is x.

301
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,480
And let's say that the impulse
response of the inverse system

302
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,930
is h_i, and the output is y.

303
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:16,850
Then, the output of this system
is x * (h * h_i).

304
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:21,830
And we want this to come
out equal to x.

305
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:28,740
And what that requires than is
that this convolution just

306
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:34,590
simply be equal to an impulse,
either in the discrete-time

307
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:38,270
case or in the continuous-time
case.

308
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:42,380
And under those conditions
then, h_i is equal to the

309
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,630
inverse of h.

310
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:49,760
Notationally, by the way, it's
often convenient to write

311
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,620
instead of h_i as the impulse
response of the inverse,

312
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:57,330
you'll find it convenient often
and more typical to

313
00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:01,970
write as the inverse, instead
of h_i, h^(-1).

314
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:10,670
And we mean by that the inverse
impulse response.

315
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:14,120
And one has to be careful not
to misinterpret this as the

316
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,610
reciprocal of h(t) or h(n).

317
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:20,260
What's meant in this notation
is the inverse system.

318
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:33,930
Now, if h_i is the inverse of
h, is h the inverse of h_i?

319
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:38,710
Well, it seems like that ought
to be plausible or perhaps

320
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,060
make sense.

321
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:43,470
The question, if you believe
that the answer is yes, is

322
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:47,300
how, in fact, do you
verify that?

323
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,860
And I'll leave it to you
to think about it.

324
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,020
The answer is yes,

325
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:54,320
that if h_i is the inverse
of h, then h is

326
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,140
the inverse of h_i.

327
00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:00,800
And the key to showing that is
to exploit the fact that when

328
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,800
we take these systems and
cascade them, we can cascade

329
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,050
them in either order.

330
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:12,200
All right now let's turn to
another system property, the

331
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,760
property of stability.

332
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:21,160
And again, we can tie that
property directly to issues

333
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:27,010
related, in particular, to the
system impulse response.

334
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:30,845
Now, stability is defined as
we've chosen to define it and

335
00:23:30,845 --> 00:23:34,530
as I've defined it previously,
as bounded-input

336
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:35,940
bounded-output stability.

337
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,140
In other words, for every
bounded input

338
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,750
is a bounded output.

339
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,850
What you can show--

340
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:45,690
and I won't go through the
algebra here; it's gone

341
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,700
through in the book--

342
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:53,160
is that a necessary and
sufficient condition for a

343
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:57,550
linear time-invariant system
to be stable in the

344
00:23:57,550 --> 00:24:03,800
bounded-input bounded-output
sense is that the impulse

345
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:08,360
response be what is referred
to as absolutely summable.

346
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:12,410
In other words, if you take the
absolute values and sum

347
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:16,300
them over infinite limits,
that's finite.

348
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:21,300
Or in the continuous-time
case, that the impulse

349
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,530
response is absolutely
integrable.

350
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:27,450
In other words, if you take the
absolute values of h(t)

351
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:29,690
and integrate, that's finite.

352
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:34,370
And under those conditions,
the system is stable.

353
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:39,070
If those conditions are
violated, then for sure, as

354
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:42,950
you'll see in the text, the
system is unstable.

355
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:46,010
So stability can also
be tied to the

356
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:47,390
system impulse response.

357
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:54,130
Now, the next property that I
want to talk about is the

358
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:56,670
property of causality.

359
00:24:56,670 --> 00:25:01,890
And before I do, what I'd like
to do is introduce a

360
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:04,690
peripheral result that
we'll then use--

361
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:06,870
when we talked about
causality--

362
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:10,690
namely what's referred to as the
zero input response of a

363
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:11,940
linear system.

364
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:18,570
The basic result, which is a
very interesting and useful

365
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:21,180
one, is that for a
linear system--

366
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:24,350
and in fact, it's whether it's
time-invariant or not, that

367
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,600
this applies--

368
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:31,640
if you put nothing into it,
you get nothing out of it.

369
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:40,460
So if we have an input x(t)
which is 0 for all t, and if

370
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:49,040
the output of that system is
y(t), if the input is 0 for

371
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:54,440
all time, then the output
likewise is 0 for all time.

372
00:25:54,440 --> 00:26:00,380
That's true for continuous time,
and it's also true for

373
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,630
discrete time.

374
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:10,380
And in fact, to show that
result is pretty much

375
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,280
straightforward.

376
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:15,570
We could do it either by using
convolution, which would, of

377
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:18,780
course, be associated with
linearity and time invariance.

378
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:22,960
But in fact, we can show that
property relatively easily by

379
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,350
simply using the fact that, for
a linear system, what we

380
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:35,180
know is that if we have an
input x(t) with an output

381
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:42,390
y(t), then if we scale the
input, then the output scales

382
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:43,940
accordingly.

383
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:51,290
Well, we can simply choose, as
the scale factor, a = 0.

384
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:54,950
And if we do that, it
says put nothing in,

385
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:57,370
you get nothing out.

386
00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:02,380
And what we'll see is that has
some important implications in

387
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:05,420
terms of causality.

388
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:09,400
It's important, though, while
we're on it, to stress that

389
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,750
not every system, obviously,
has that property.

390
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:14,380
That if you put nothing in,
you get nothing out.

391
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:19,980
A simple example is, let's say,
a battery, let's say not

392
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,330
connected to anything.

393
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:25,250
The output is six volts no
matter what the input is.

394
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:29,970
And it of course then doesn't
have this zero response to a

395
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:31,150
zero input.

396
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:35,170
It's very particular
to linear systems.

397
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:40,640
All right, well now let's see
what this means for causality.

398
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,500
To remind you, causality says,
in effect, that the system

399
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,060
can't anticipate the input.

400
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:50,260
That's what, basically,
causality means.

401
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:54,470
When we talked about it
previously, we defined it in a

402
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:59,100
variety of ways, one of which
was the statement that if two

403
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:05,130
inputs are identical up until
some time, then the outputs

404
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:08,140
must be identical up until
the same time.

405
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:11,880
The reason, kind of intuitively,
is that if the

406
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,190
system is causal--

407
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:15,290
so it can't anticipate
the future--

408
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:18,970
it can't anticipate whether
these two identical inputs are

409
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:22,530
sometime later going to change
from each other or not.

410
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:30,410
So causality, in general, is
simply this statement, either

411
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:34,030
continuous-time or
discrete-time.

412
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:37,200
And now, so let's look
at what that means

413
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,400
for a linear system.

414
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:44,020
For a linear system, what that
corresponds to or could be

415
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:51,500
translated to is a statement
that says that if x(t) is 0,

416
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:58,050
for t less than t_0, then
y(t) must be 0 for t

417
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:00,580
less than t_0 also.

418
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:07,790
And so what that, in effect,
says, is that the system--

419
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:14,010
for a linear system to be
causal, it must have the

420
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:19,200
property sometimes referred to
as initial rest, meaning it

421
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,850
doesn't respond until there's
some input that happens.

422
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:26,250
That it's initially
at rest until the

423
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:29,680
input becomes non-zero.

424
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,050
Now, why is this true?

425
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:37,690
Why is this a consequence of
causality for linear systems?

426
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:40,980
Well, the reason is we know that
if we put nothing in, we

427
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,630
get nothing out.

428
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:48,320
If we have an input that's 0 for
t less than t_0, and the

429
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,830
system can't anticipate whether
that input is going to

430
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:58,950
change from 0 or not, then the
system must generate an output

431
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:03,940
that's 0 up until that time,
following the principle that

432
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:07,360
if two inputs are identical up
until some time, the outputs

433
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,660
must be identical up until
the same time.

434
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:18,750
So this basic result for linear
systems is essentially

435
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:24,590
a consequence of the statement
that for a linear system, zero

436
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:29,010
in gives us zero out.

437
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:40,390
Now, that tells us
how to interpret

438
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:43,190
causality for linear systems.

439
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:46,360
Now, let's proceed to linear
time-invariant systems.

440
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:50,900
And in fact, we can carry the
point one step further.

441
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:55,380
In particular, a necessary and
sufficient condition for

442
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:59,840
causality in the case of linear
time-invariant systems

443
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:08,570
is that the impulse response be
0, for t less than 0 in the

444
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:13,030
continuous-time case, or for
n less than 0 in the

445
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,630
discrete-time case.

446
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:18,660
So for linear time-invariant
systems, causality is

447
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:24,310
equivalent to the impulse
response being 0 up until t or

448
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:27,090
n equal to 0.

449
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:35,330
Now, to show this essentially
follows by first considering

450
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:42,710
why causality would imply
that this is true.

451
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:47,790
And that follows because of the
straightforward fact that

452
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:50,910
the impulse itself is
0 for t less than 0.

453
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:58,480
And what we saw before is that
for any linear system,

454
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,280
causality requires that if the
input is 0 up until some time,

455
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:06,170
the output must be 0 up
until the same time.

456
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:11,740
And so that's showing the
result in one direction.

457
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:15,775
To show the result in the other
direction, namely to

458
00:32:15,775 --> 00:32:20,820
show that if, in fact, the
impulse response satisfies

459
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,860
that condition, then the
system is causal.

460
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:28,170
While I won't work through it
in detail, it essentially

461
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:36,830
boils down to recognizing that
in the convolution sum, or in

462
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:41,880
the convolution integral, if,
in fact, that condition is

463
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:46,950
satisfied on the impulse
response, then the upper limit

464
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:48,880
on the sum, in the
discrete-time

465
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,900
case, changes to n.

466
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:54,370
And in the continuous-time
case, changes to t.

467
00:32:54,370 --> 00:33:00,940
And that, in effect, says that
values of the input only from

468
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:05,840
-infinity up to time n are
used in computing y[n].

469
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,770
And a similar kind
of result for the

470
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:11,140
continuous-time case y(t).

471
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:20,330
OK, so we've seen how the
impulse response, or rather

472
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:23,170
how certain system properties
in the linear time-invariant

473
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:28,920
case can, be converted into
various requirements on the

474
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,670
impulse response of a linear
time-invariant system, the

475
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:35,440
impulse response being a
complete characterization.

476
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,390
Let's look at some particular
examples just to kind of

477
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:42,140
cement the ideas further.

478
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:46,190
And let's begin with a system
that you've seen previously,

479
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,165
which is an accumulator.

480
00:33:48,165 --> 00:33:55,860
An accumulator, as you recall,
has an output y[n], which is

481
00:33:55,860 --> 00:34:03,080
the accumulated value of the
input from -infinity up to n.

482
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:07,660
Now, you've seen in the impulse
in a previous lecture,

483
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:11,239
or rather in the video course
manual for a previous lecture,

484
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:15,429
that an accumulator is a linear
time-invariant system.

485
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:19,760
And in fact, its impulse
response is the accumulated

486
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,370
values of an impulse.

487
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:24,855
Namely, the impulse response
is equal to a step.

488
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:34,010
So what we want to answer is,
knowing what that impulse

489
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:36,929
response is, what some
properties are of the

490
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:38,280
accumulator.

491
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,420
And let's first ask
about memory.

492
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:46,679
Well, we recognize that the
impulse response is not simply

493
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:47,300
an impulse.

494
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,830
In fact, it's a step.

495
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:51,560
And so this implies what?

496
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:55,530
Well, it implies that the
system has memory.

497
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:06,780
Second, the impulse response
is 0 for n less than 0.

498
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:11,180
That implies that the
system is causal.

499
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:22,530
And finally, if we look at the
sum of the absolute values of

500
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:24,930
the impulse response
from -infinity to

501
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:27,380
+infinity, this is a step.

502
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:30,790
If we accumulate those values
over infinite limits, then

503
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:35,210
that in fact comes out
to be infinite.

504
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:40,140
And so what that implies, then,
is that the accumulator

505
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:43,490
is not stable in the
bounded-input

506
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:44,780
bounded-output sense.

507
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,410
Now I want to turn to
some other systems.

508
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:52,630
But while we're on the
accumulator, I just want to

509
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:55,900
draw your attention to the fact,
which will kind of come

510
00:35:55,900 --> 00:36:01,350
up in a variety of ways again
later, that we can rewrite the

511
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:04,840
equation for an accumulator,
the difference equation, by

512
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:10,460
recognizing that we could, in
fact, write the output as the

513
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:14,540
accumulated values up to
time n - 1 and then

514
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:17,120
add on the last value.

515
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:23,510
And in fact, if we do that, this
corresponds to y[n-1].

516
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:28,330
And so we could rewrite this
difference equation as y[n]

517
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:30,090
= y[n-1]

518
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:31,340
+ x[n].

519
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:34,630
So the output is the
previously-computed output

520
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,800
plus the input.

521
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:42,170
Expressed that way, what that
corresponds to is what is

522
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:44,400
called a recursive difference
equation.

523
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,980
And different equations will
be a topic of considerable

524
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:51,290
emphasis in the next lecture.

525
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:53,520
Now, does an accumulator
have an inverse?

526
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,100
Well, the answer is,
in fact, yes.

527
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:02,190
And let's look at what the
inverse of the accumulator is.

528
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:06,290
The impulse response of the
accumulator is a step.

529
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:11,100
To inquire about its inverse,
we inquire about whether

530
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:15,780
there's a system, which when
we cascade the accumulator

531
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:20,510
with that system, which I'm
calling its inverse, we get an

532
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:22,410
impulse out.

533
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:23,800
Well, let's see.

534
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:28,060
The impulse response of the
accumulator is a step.

535
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,820
We want to put the step
into something

536
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:32,470
and get out an impulse.

537
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:37,500
And in fact, what you recall
from the lecture in which we

538
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:42,120
introduced steps and impulses,
the impulse is, in fact, the

539
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,630
first difference of
the units step.

540
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:50,210
So we have a difference equation
that describes for us

541
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:54,660
how the impulse is related
to the step.

542
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:59,770
And so if this system does this,
the output will be that,

543
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:01,420
an impulse.

544
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:04,465
And so if we think of x_2[n]

545
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,470
as the input and y_2[n]

546
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:14,410
as the output, then the
difference equation for the

547
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:18,330
inverse system is what
I've indicated here.

548
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:22,200
And if we want to look at the
impulse response of that, we

549
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,120
can then inquire as to what
the response is with an

550
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,830
impulse in.

551
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:31,290
And what develops in a
straightforward way then is

552
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:37,580
delta[n], which is our impulse
input, minus delta[n-1]

553
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:40,530
is equal to the impulse
response

554
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:42,730
of the inverse system.

555
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:45,260
So I'll write that
as h^(-1)[n]

556
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:47,410
(h-inverse of n).

557
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:52,420
Now, we have then that the
accumulator has an inverse.

558
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,420
And this is the inverse.

559
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:57,910
And you can examine issues
of memory, stability,

560
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:59,430
causality, et cetera.

561
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:05,170
What you'll find is that the
system has memory, the inverse

562
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:05,810
accumulator.

563
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:09,360
It's stable, and it's causal.

564
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,360
And it's interesting to note, by
the way, that although the

565
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:17,620
accumulator was an unstable
system, the inverse of the

566
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,930
accumulator is a
stable system.

567
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:24,680
In general, if the system is
stable, its inverse does not

568
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,940
have to be stable
or vice versa.

569
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,365
And the same thing
with causality.

570
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:38,360
OK now, there are a number of
other examples, which, of

571
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,200
course, we could discuss.

572
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:46,830
And let me just quickly point
to one example, which is a

573
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:50,640
difference equation, as
I've indicated here.

574
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:55,980
And as we'll talk about in
more detail in our next

575
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:59,480
lecture, where we'll get
involved in a fairly detailed

576
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,360
discussion of linear
constant-coefficient

577
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,690
difference and differential
equations, this falls into

578
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:06,290
that category.

579
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:10,960
And under the imposition of
what's referred to as initial

580
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:17,970
rest, which corresponds to the
response being 0 up until the

581
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:22,450
time that the input becomes
non-zero, the impulse response

582
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:25,410
is a^n times u[n].

583
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:29,490
And something that you'll be
asked to think about in the

584
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:33,490
video course manual is whether
that system has memory,

585
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:36,550
whether it's causal, and
whether it's stable.

586
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:41,700
And likewise, for a linear
constant coefficient

587
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:46,070
differential equation, the
specific one that I've

588
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:50,020
indicated here, under the
assumption of initial rest,

589
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:54,710
the impulse response is
e^(-2t) times u(t).

590
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:58,810
And in the video course manual
again, you'll be asked to

591
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:02,930
examine whether the system has
memory, whether it's causal,

592
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:06,410
and whether it's stable.

593
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:10,420
OK well, as I've indicated, in
the next lecture we'll return

594
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:13,270
to a much more detailed
discussion of linear

595
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:15,180
constant-coefficient
differential

596
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,190
and difference equations.

597
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:22,480
Now, what I'd like to finally do
in this lecture is use the

598
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,410
notion of convolution in a much
different way to help us

599
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:30,030
with a problem that I
alluded to earlier.

600
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:33,800
In particular, the issue of how
to deal with some of the

601
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,200
mathematical difficulties
associated with

602
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,620
impulses and steps.

603
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:43,540
Now, let me begin by
illustrating kind of what the

604
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:49,845
problem is and an example of the
kind of paradox that you

605
00:41:49,845 --> 00:41:53,480
sort of run into when dealing
with impulse functions and

606
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,730
step functions.

607
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,980
Let's consider, first of all,
a system, which is the

608
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,520
identity system.

609
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:07,090
And so the output is, of course,
equal to the input.

610
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:12,180
And again, we can talk about
that either in continuous time

611
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:14,800
or in discrete time.

612
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,990
Well, we know that the function
that you convolve

613
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:23,610
with a signal to retain the
signal is an impulse.

614
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:26,650
And so that means that the
impulse response of an

615
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:28,740
identity system is an impulse.

616
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:32,220
Makes logical sense.

617
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:36,300
Furthermore, if I take two
identity systems and cascade

618
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:40,240
them, I put in an input, get
the same thing out of the

619
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:40,900
first system.

620
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,190
That goes into the
second system.

621
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:44,125
Get the same thing out
of the second.

622
00:42:44,125 --> 00:42:51,540
In other words, if I have two
identity systems in cascade,

623
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:55,840
the cascade, likewise, is
an identity system.

624
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:59,020
In other words, this
overall system is

625
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:03,280
also an identity system.

626
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,610
And the implication there is
that the impulse response of

627
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:09,110
this is an impulse.

628
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:11,750
The impulse response of
this is an impulse.

629
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:16,560
And the convolution of those
two is also an impulse.

630
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:21,860
So for continuous time, we
require, then, that an impulse

631
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:24,550
convolved with itself
is an impulse.

632
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:28,850
And the same thing for
discrete time.

633
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:33,280
Now, in discrete time, we don't
have any particular

634
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,220
problem with that.

635
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:37,130
If you think about convolving
these together, it's a

636
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:42,850
straightforward mathematical
operation since the impulse in

637
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:47,300
discrete time is very
nicely defined.

638
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:51,070
However, in continuous time, we
have to be somewhat careful

639
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:54,710
about the definition of the
impulse because it was the

640
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:55,870
derivative of a step.

641
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:57,930
A step has a discontinuity.

642
00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:01,190
You can't really differentiate
at a discontinuity.

643
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:06,020
And the way that we dealt with
that was to expand out the

644
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:09,570
discontinuity so that it had
some finite time region in

645
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:11,090
which it happened.

646
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:14,080
When we did that, we ended up
with a definition for the

647
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:18,200
impulse, which was the
limiting form of this

648
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:23,510
function, which is a rectangle
of width Delta, and height 1 /

649
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:27,120
Delta, and an area equal to 1.

650
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:33,680
Now, if we think of convolving
this signal with itself, the

651
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:37,480
impulse being the limiting
form of this, then the

652
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:42,690
convolution of this with itself
is a triangle of width

653
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:47,290
2 Delta, height 1 /
Delta, and area 1.

654
00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:51,560
In other words, this triangular
function is this

655
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:59,030
approximation delta_Delta(t)
convolved with delta_Delta(t).

656
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:05,000
And since the limit of this
would correspond to the

657
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:11,480
impulse response of the identity
system convolved with

658
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:17,470
itself, the implication is that
not only should the top

659
00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:23,600
function, this one, correspond
in its limiting form to an

660
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:28,130
impulse, but also this should
correspond in its limiting

661
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:29,990
form to an impulse.

662
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:32,750
So one could wonder well,
what is an impulse?

663
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:34,320
Is it this one in the limit?

664
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,650
Or is it this one
in the limit?

665
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,420
Now, beyond that-- so kind of
what this suggests is that in

666
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:48,360
the limiting form, you kind of
run into a contradiction

667
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:50,920
unless you don't try to
distinguish between this

668
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:53,170
rectangle and the triangle.

669
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:57,050
Things get even worse when you
think about what happens when

670
00:45:57,050 --> 00:45:59,160
you put an impulse into
a differentiator.

671
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:03,630
And a differentiator is a very
commonly occurring system.

672
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:08,350
In particular, suppose we had a
system for which the output

673
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:11,010
was the derivative
of the input.

674
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:17,500
So if we put in x(t), we
got out dx(t) / dt.

675
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:20,360
If I put in an impulse, or if
I talked about the impulse

676
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:23,130
response, what is that?

677
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:27,610
And of course, the problem is
that if you think that the

678
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:31,880
impulse itself is very badly
behaved, then what about its

679
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:36,110
derivative, which is not only
infinitely big, but there's a

680
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:38,350
positive-going one, and a
negative-going one, and the

681
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:40,440
difference between there
has some area.

682
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,910
And you end up in a
lot of difficulty.

683
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:51,250
Well, the way around this,
formally, is through a set of

684
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:56,140
mathematics referred to as
generalized functions.

685
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:58,110
We won't be quite that formal.

686
00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:01,340
But I'd like to, at least,
suggest what the essence of

687
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:02,530
that formality is.

688
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:07,360
And it really helps us in
interpreting the impulses in

689
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,620
steps and functions
of that type.

690
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:13,660
And what it is is an operational
definition of

691
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:16,560
steps, impulses, and their
derivatives in

692
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,360
the following sense.

693
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:21,600
Usually when we talk about a
function, we talk about what

694
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,910
the value of the function is
at any instant of time.

695
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:26,810
And of course, the trouble
with an impulse is it's

696
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:30,930
infinitely big, in zero width,
and has some area, et cetera.

697
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:35,310
What we can turn to is what is
referred to as an operational

698
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:41,550
definition where the operational
definition is

699
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:45,790
related not to what the impulse
is, but to what the

700
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:50,760
impulse does under the operation
of convolution.

701
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,540
So what is an impulse?

702
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:56,110
An impulse is something,
which under

703
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:59,460
convolution, retains the function.

704
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:04,200
And that then can serve as a
definition of the impulse.

705
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,410
Well, let's see where
that gets us.

706
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:11,060
Suppose that we now want to talk
about the derivative of

707
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:13,370
the impulse.

708
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:18,970
Well, what we ask about is
what it is operationally.

709
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:25,510
And so if we have a system,
which is a differentiator, and

710
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:28,600
we inquire about its impulse
response, which let's say we

711
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:32,630
define notationally as u_1(t).

712
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:37,650
What's important about this
function u_1(t) is not what it

713
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:42,620
is at each value of time
but what it does under

714
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:43,840
convolution.

715
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,690
What does it do under
convolution?

716
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:49,610
Well, the output of the
differentiator is the

717
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:53,190
convolution of the input with
the impulse response.

718
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:58,100
And so what u_1(t) does under
convolution is to

719
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:59,780
differentiate.

720
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:03,770
And that is the operational
definition.

721
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:07,450
And now, of course, we can
think of extending that.

722
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:11,540
Not only would we want to think
about differentiating an

723
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:15,960
impulse, but we would also
want to think about

724
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,740
differentiating the derivative
of an impulse.

725
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:23,000
We'll define that as
a function u_2(t).

726
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,690
u_2(t)--

727
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:28,050
because we have this impulse
response convolved with this

728
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:31,700
one is u_1(t) * u_1(t).

729
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:36,800
And what is u_2(t)
operationally?

730
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:42,800
It is the operation such that
when you convolve that with

731
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:48,540
x(t), what you get is the
second derivative.

732
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:52,110
OK now, we can carry this
further and, in fact, talk

733
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:59,410
about the result of convolving
u_1(t) with itself more times.

734
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:03,870
In fact, if we think of the
convulution of u_1(t) with

735
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:07,460
itself k times, then
logically we would

736
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:11,330
define that as u_k(t).

737
00:50:11,330 --> 00:50:14,800
Again, we would interpret
that operationally.

738
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:20,440
And the operational definition
is through convolution, where

739
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:26,600
this corresponds to u_k(t) being
the impulse response of

740
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:29,630
k differentiators in cascade.

741
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:32,090
So what is the operational
definition?

742
00:50:32,090 --> 00:50:39,800
Well, it's simply that x(t)
* u_k(t) is the k

743
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,440
derivative of x(t).

744
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:49,480
And this now gives us a set
of what are referred to as

745
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:50,720
singularity functions.

746
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:55,360
Very badly behaved
mathematically in a sense, but

747
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:58,700
as we've seen, reasonably well
defined under an operational

748
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:00,780
definition.

749
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:06,010
With k = 0, incidentally, that's
the same as what we

750
00:51:06,010 --> 00:51:08,560
have referred to previously
as the impulse.

751
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:13,260
So with k 0, that's
just delta(t).

752
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:17,150
Now to be complete, we can also
go the other way and talk

753
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:20,940
about the impulse response of
a string of integrators

754
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:23,460
instead of a string of
differentiators.

755
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:25,280
Of course, the impulse
response of a single

756
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,580
integrator is a unit step.

757
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:30,120
Two integrators together
is the integral of a

758
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,680
unit step, et cetera.

759
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:38,110
And that, likewise, corresponds
to a set of what

760
00:51:38,110 --> 00:51:40,290
are called singularity
functions.

761
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:46,410
In particular, if I take a
string of m integrators in

762
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:52,610
cascade, then the impulse
response of that is denoted as

763
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:56,000
u sub minus m of t.

764
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,380
And for example, with a single
integrator, u sub minus 1 of t

765
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:06,950
corresponds to our unit step as
we talked about previously.

766
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:14,430
u sub minus 2 of t corresponds
to a unit ramp, et cetera.

767
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:18,060
And there is, in fact, a reason
for choosing negative

768
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:22,850
values of the argument when
going in one direction near

769
00:52:22,850 --> 00:52:25,370
integration as compared with
positive values of the

770
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:28,130
argument when going in the
other direction, namely

771
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:30,120
differentiation.

772
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:38,110
In particular, we know that with
u sub minus m of t, the

773
00:52:38,110 --> 00:52:44,520
operational definition is the
mth running integral.

774
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:48,370
And likewise, u_k(t)--

775
00:52:48,370 --> 00:52:51,040
so with a positive
sub script--

776
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:56,240
has an operational definition,
which is the derivative.

777
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:01,290
So it's the kth derivative
of x(t).

778
00:53:01,290 --> 00:53:08,070
And partly as a consequence of
that, if we take u_k(t) and

779
00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:13,400
convolve it with u_l(t), the
result is the singularity

780
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:17,170
function with the subscript,
which is the sum of k and l.

781
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:21,470
And that holds whether this
is positive values of the

782
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:24,610
subscript or negative values
of the subscript.

783
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:28,550
So just to summarize this last
discussion, we've used an

784
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:35,520
operational definition to talk
about derivatives of impulses

785
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,940
and integrals of impulses.

786
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:40,705
This led to a set of singularity
functions-- what

787
00:53:40,705 --> 00:53:42,270
I've called singularity
functions--

788
00:53:42,270 --> 00:53:45,400
of which the impulse and the
step are two examples.

789
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:49,700
But using an operational
definition through convolution

790
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:55,500
allows us to define, at least in
an operational sense, these

791
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,880
functions that otherwise
are very badly behaved.

792
00:54:01,110 --> 00:54:06,330
OK now, in this lecture and
previous lectures, for the

793
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:10,890
most part, our discussion
has been about linear

794
00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:14,910
time-invariant systems in
fairly general terms.

795
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:18,480
And we've seen a variety of
properties, representation

796
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,390
through convolution, and
properties as they can be

797
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:25,750
associated with the
impulse response.

798
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:28,970
In the next lecture, we'll turn
our attention to a very

799
00:54:28,970 --> 00:54:34,150
important subclass of those
systems, namely systems that

800
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:37,410
are describable by linear
constant-coefficient

801
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:40,640
difference equations in the
discrete-time case, and linear

802
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,540
constant-coefficient
differential equations in the

803
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:45,410
continuous-time case.

804
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:50,800
Those classes, while not forming
all of the class of

805
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:53,080
linear time-invariant
systems, are a very

806
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,930
important sub class.

807
00:54:54,930 --> 00:54:57,470
And we'll focus in on those
specifically next time.

808
00:54:57,470 --> 00:54:58,720
Thank you.
