9
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,740
PROFESSOR: During the course,
we've developed a number of

10
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,220
very powerful and
useful tools.

11
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,519
And we've seen how these can
be used in designing and

12
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:05,970
analyzing systems.

13
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,750
For example, for filtering,
for modulation, et cetera.

14
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:14,380
I'd like to conclude this series
of lectures with an

15
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,670
introduction to one more
important topic.

16
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:22,320
Namely, the analysis of
feedback systems.

17
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,700
And one of the principle reasons
that we have left this

18
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,900
discussion to the last part of
the course is so that we can

19
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:36,570
exploit some of the ideas that
we've just developed in some

20
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,490
of the previous lectures.

21
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,350
Namely, the tools afforded us
by Laplace and z-transforms.

22
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:52,300
Now, as I had indicated in one
of the very first lectures, a

23
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,080
common example of a feedback
system is the problem of,

24
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,790
let's say balancing a broom, or
in the case of that lecture

25
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:04,480
balancing my son's horse in
the palm of your hand.

26
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,610
And kind of the idea there is
that what that relies on, in

27
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:14,320
order to make that a stable
system, is feedback.

28
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,680
In that particular case,
visual feedback.

29
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,470
That specific problem, the one
of balancing something, let's

30
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:26,230
say in the palm of your hand,
is an example of a problem,

31
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:29,880
which is commonly referred to
as the inverted pendulum.

32
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,250
And it's one that we will
actually be analyzing in a

33
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,400
fair amount of detail
not in this lecture,

34
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,820
but in the next lecture.

35
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,510
But let me just kind of indicate
what some of the

36
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,670
issues are.

37
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,030
Let me describe this in the
context not of balancing a

38
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,410
broom on your hand, but let's
say that we have a mechanical

39
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,730
system which consists
of a cart.

40
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:55,770
And the cart can move, let's say
in one dimension, and it

41
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:01,460
has mounted on it a bar, a rod
with a weight on the top, and

42
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,880
it pivots around the base.

43
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,510
So that essentially represents
the inverted pendulum.

44
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:10,510
So that system can be, more
or less, depicted as I've

45
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,210
indicated here.

46
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:16,650
And this is the cart that can
move along the x-axis.

47
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,660
And here we have a pivot
point, a rod, a

48
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,000
weight at the top.

49
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,100
And then, of course, there are
several forces acting on this.

50
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,740
There is an acceleration that
can be applied to the cart,

51
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:33,290
and that will be thought of
as the external input.

52
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:37,130
And then on the pendulum itself,
on the weight, there

53
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,080
is the force of gravity.

54
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,130
And then typically, a set of
external disturbances that

55
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:46,840
might represent, for example,
air currents, or wind, or

56
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:53,630
whatever, that will attempt
to destabilize the system.

57
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:58,440
Specifically, to have the
pendulum fall down.

58
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,470
Now, if we look at this system
in, more or less, a

59
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:07,150
straightforward way, what we
have then are the system

60
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:14,200
dynamics and several inputs, one
of which is the external

61
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:19,570
disturbances and a second is the
acceleration, which is the

62
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:21,990
external acceleration
that's applied.

63
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:25,510
And the output of the system
can be thought of as the

64
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,590
angular displacement
of the pendulum.

65
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:31,330
Which if we want it balanced,
we would like that angular

66
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:34,430
displacement to be equal to 0.

67
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:39,330
Now, if we know exactly what the
system dynamics are and if

68
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:43,280
we knew exactly what the
external disturbances are,

69
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,500
then in principle, we could
design an acceleration.

70
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,850
Namely, an input.

71
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:51,710
That would exactly generate
0 output.

72
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:54,440
In other words, the angle
would be equal to 0.

73
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,750
But as you can imagine, just as
it's basically impossible

74
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,830
to balance a broom in the palm
of your hand with you eyes

75
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:08,030
closed, what is very hard to
ascertain in advance are what

76
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:11,100
the various dynamics and
disturbances are.

77
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,040
And so more typically what you
would think of doing is

78
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:20,130
measuring the output angle,
and then using that

79
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:24,220
measurement to somehow
influence the applied

80
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,920
acceleration or force.

81
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,670
And that, then, is an example
of a feedback system.

82
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:37,160
So we would measure the output
angle and generate an input

83
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:42,960
acceleration, which is some
function of what that

84
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,300
output angle is.

85
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:48,310
And if we choose the feedback
dynamics correctly, then in

86
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:52,430
fact, we can drive
this output to 0.

87
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:57,640
This is one example of a system
which is inherently

88
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,680
unstable because if we left
it to its own devices, the

89
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,760
pendulum would simply
fall down.

90
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,140
And essentially, by applying
feedback, what we're trying to

91
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:10,390
do is stabilize this inherently
unstable system.

92
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:13,560
And we'll talk a little bit
more about that specific

93
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,030
application of feedback
shortly.

94
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:21,400
Another common example of
feedback is in positioning or

95
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:26,460
tracking systems, and I indicate
one here which

96
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:31,790
corresponds to the problem of
positioning a telescope, which

97
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:34,000
is mounted on a rotating
platform.

98
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,110
So in a system of that type, for
example, I indicate here

99
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,950
the rotating platform
and the telescope.

100
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:44,310
It's driven by a motor.

101
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:48,070
And again, we could imagine, in
principle, the possibility

102
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:53,320
of driving this to the desired
angle by choosing an

103
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,370
appropriate applied
input voltage.

104
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:59,230
And as long as we know such
things as what the

105
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:02,540
disturbances are that influence
the telescope mount

106
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:06,460
and what the characteristics of
the motor are, in principle

107
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:10,250
we could in fact carry this
out in a form which is

108
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,920
referred to as open loop.

109
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:16,280
Namely, we can choose an
appropriate input voltage to

110
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:22,020
drive the motor to set the
platform angle at the desired

111
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,450
angular position.

112
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:28,350
However, again, there are enough
unknowns in a problem

113
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:33,790
like that, so that one is
motivated to employ feedback.

114
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:39,160
Namely, to make a measurement
of the output angle and use

115
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:44,430
that in a feedback loop to
influence the drive for the

116
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:49,410
motor, so that the telescope
platform is positioned

117
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:50,610
appropriately.

118
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:56,950
So if we look at this in a
feedback context, we would

119
00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:05,020
then take the measured output
angle and the measured output

120
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:09,930
angle would be fed
back and compared

121
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:12,810
with the desired angle.

122
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:16,340
And the difference between
those, which essentially is

123
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,240
the error between the platform
positioning and the desired

124
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,880
position would be put perhaps
through an appropriate gain or

125
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:28,870
attenuation and used as the
excitation to the motor.

126
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:32,659
So in the mechanical or physical
system, that would

127
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:37,900
correspond to measuring the
angle, let's say with a

128
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,169
potentiometer.

129
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:42,770
So here we're measuring the
angle and we have an output,

130
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:45,700
which is proportional to
that measured angle.

131
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:52,290
And then we would use feedback,
comparing the

132
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:57,670
measured angle to some
proportionality factor

133
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,550
multiplying the desired angle.

134
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:05,190
So here we have the desired
angle, again through some type

135
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,660
of potentiometer.

136
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,710
The two are compared.

137
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:12,160
Out of the comparator, we
basically have an indication

138
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,890
of what the difference is, and
that represents an error

139
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:17,230
between the desired and
the true angle.

140
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:22,160
And then that is used through
perhaps an amplifier to

141
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,630
control the motor.

142
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:28,240
And in that case, of course,
when the error goes to 0, that

143
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,960
means that the actual
angle and the

144
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,010
desired angle are equal.

145
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:35,930
And in fact, in that case also
with this system, the input to

146
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:40,210
the motor is, likewise,
equal to 0.

147
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:44,520
Now, as I've illustrated it
here, it tends to be in the

148
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,840
context of a continuous
time or analog system.

149
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,770
And in fact, another very
common way of doing

150
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:58,890
positioning or tracking is to
instead implement the feedback

151
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:02,300
using a discrete-time
or digital system.

152
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:07,760
And so in that case, we would
basically take the position

153
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:13,310
output as it's measured, sample
it, essentially convert

154
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:18,460
that to a digital discrete-time
signal.

155
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:23,330
And then that is used in
conjunction with the desired

156
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:30,060
angle, which both form inputs
to this processor.

157
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:34,770
And the output of that is
converted, let's say, back to

158
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:38,120
an analog or continuous-time
voltage and used

159
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,100
to drive the motor.

160
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:45,040
Now, you could ask, why would
you go to a digital or

161
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,150
discrete-time measurement rather
than doing it the way I

162
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,340
showed on the previous overlay
which seemed relatively

163
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,530
straightforward?

164
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:55,710
And the reason, principally,
is that in the context of a

165
00:10:55,710 --> 00:11:00,360
digital implementation of the
feedback process, often you

166
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,220
can implement a better
controlled and often also,

167
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:10,140
more sophisticated algorithm
for the feedback dynamics.

168
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:13,310
So that you can take a count,
perhaps not only of the angle

169
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:16,970
itself, but also of the rate
of change of angle.

170
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,720
And in fact, the rate of
change of the rate

171
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,270
of change of angle.

172
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:27,230
So the system, as it's shown
there then, basically has a

173
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:30,350
discrete-time or digital
feedback loop around a

174
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:33,070
continuous time system.

175
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:38,950
Now, this is an example of, in
fact, a more general way in

176
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:42,590
which discrete-time
feedback is used

177
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:44,950
with continuous systems.

178
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:50,950
And let me indicate, in general,
what the character or

179
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:53,510
block diagram of such
a system might be.

180
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:57,860
Typically, if we abstract away
from the telescope positioning

181
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:01,420
system, we might have
a more general

182
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,730
continuous-time system.

183
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:07,980
And around which we want to
apply some feedback, which we

184
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,920
could do with a continuous-time
system or with

185
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:16,150
a discrete-time system by first
converting these signals

186
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:20,310
to discrete-time signals.

187
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:24,620
Then, processing that with
a discrete-time system.

188
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,440
And then, through an appropriate
interpolation

189
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,670
algorithm, we would then
convert that back to a

190
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,580
continuous-time signal.

191
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:39,030
And the difference between
the input signal and this

192
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:42,270
continuous-time signal which
is fed back, then forms the

193
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:45,220
excitation to the system
that essentially

194
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,870
we're trying to control.

195
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:52,280
And in many systems of this
type, the advantage is that

196
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:56,710
this system can be implemented
in a very reproducible way,

197
00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:01,240
either with a digital computer
or with a microprocessor.

198
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,110
And although we're not going to
go into this in any detail

199
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,850
in this lecture, there
is some discussion

200
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,580
of this in the text.

201
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:14,370
Essentially, if we make certain
assumptions about this

202
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:19,980
particular feedback system, we
can move the continuous to

203
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:25,340
discrete-time converter up to
this point and to this point,

204
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:30,060
and we can move the
interpolating system outside

205
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,500
the summer.

206
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:37,220
And what happens in that case
is that we end up with what

207
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:42,730
looks like an inherently
discrete-time feedback system.

208
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:46,280
So, in fact, if we take those
steps, then what we'll end up

209
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:52,260
with for a feedback system is a
system that essentially can

210
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,890
be analyzed as a discrete-time
system.

211
00:13:55,890 --> 00:14:00,820
Here we have what is, in the
forward path, is basically the

212
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,550
continuous-time system with the
interpolator at one end

213
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,450
and the continuous to
discrete-time converter

214
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:07,700
at the other end.

215
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:11,640
And then we have whatever system
it was in the feedback

216
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,090
loop-- discrete-time--

217
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:16,900
that shows up in this
feedback loop.

218
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:21,410
Well, I show this mainly to
emphasize the fact, although

219
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:24,500
there are some steps there that
we obviously left out.

220
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,080
I show that mainly to emphasize
the fact that

221
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,890
feedback arises not just in the
context of continuous-time

222
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:36,140
systems, but also the analysis
of discrete-time feedback

223
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,240
systems becomes important.

224
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,600
Perhaps because we have used
discrete-time feedback around

225
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,540
a continuous-time system.

226
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:49,850
But also perhaps because the
feedback system is inherently

227
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:50,660
discrete-time.

228
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:54,980
And let me just illustrate one,
or indicate one example

229
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,850
in which that might arise.

230
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:03,290
This is an example which is
also discussed in somewhat

231
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:05,270
more detail in the text.

232
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:09,990
But basically, population
studies, for example,

233
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:12,480
represent examples of

234
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,840
discrete-time feedback systems.

235
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:19,590
Where let's say that we have
some type of model for

236
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,200
population growth.

237
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,180
And since people come in
integer amounts that

238
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:30,950
represents essentially the
output of any population

239
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:33,080
model, essentially
or inherently

240
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,330
represents a sequence.

241
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:38,630
Namely, it's indexed on
an integer variable.

242
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:42,810
And typically, models for
population growth

243
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,720
are unstable systems.

244
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,240
You can kind of imagine that
because if you take these

245
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,950
simple models of population,
what happens is that in any

246
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:59,050
generation, the number of
people, or animals, or

247
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:02,590
whatever it is that this is
modeling, grows essentially

248
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:07,750
exponentially with the size of
the previous generation.

249
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,360
Now, where does the
feedback come in?

250
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,370
Well, the feedback typically
comes in, in incorporating in

251
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:17,090
the overall model various
retarding factors.

252
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:20,920
For example, as the population
increases, the food supply

253
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,360
becomes more limited.

254
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:30,030
And that essentially is a
feedback process that acts to

255
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,510
retard the population growth.

256
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:35,360
And so an overall model--

257
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,610
somewhat simplified--

258
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:44,170
for a population system is the
open loop model in the absence

259
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,270
of retarding factors.

260
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:50,200
And then, very often the
retarding factors can be

261
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:55,490
described as being related to
the size of the population.

262
00:16:55,490 --> 00:17:02,210
And those essentially act to
reduce the overall input to

263
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:04,060
the population model.

264
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:09,560
And so population studies are
one very common example of

265
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,205
discrete-time feedback
systems.

266
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:19,720
Well, what we want to look at
and understand are the basic

267
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,030
properties of feedback
systems.

268
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:27,910
And to do that, let's look at
the basic block diagram and

269
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:30,530
equations for feedback
systems, either

270
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:33,820
continuous-time or
discrete-time.

271
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:38,540
Let's begin with the
continuous-time case.

272
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:44,670
And now what we've done is
simply abstract out any of the

273
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:49,150
applications to a fairly general
system, in which we

274
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:54,980
have a system H of s in what's
referred to as the forward

275
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:59,590
path, and a system G of s
in the feedback path.

276
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:07,600
The input to the system H of s
is the difference between the

277
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,320
input to the overall system
and the output of

278
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,020
the feedback loop.

279
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:17,020
And I draw your attention
to the fact that what we

280
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,440
illustrate here and what we're

281
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,710
analyzing is negative feedback.

282
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:25,010
Namely, this output is
subtracted from the input.

283
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:29,170
And that's done more for reasons
of convention then for

284
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:30,370
any other reasons.

285
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:34,770
It's typical to do that and
appropriate certainly in some

286
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:37,040
feedback systems, but not all.

287
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,350
And the output of the adder is
commonly referred to as the

288
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:44,400
error signal, indicating that
it's the difference between

289
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,280
the signal fed back and the
input to the overall system.

290
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,310
Now, if we want to analyze the
feedback system, we would do

291
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:55,540
that essentially by writing
the appropriate equations.

292
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:01,220
In generating the equivalent
system function for the

293
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:06,780
overall system, it's best done
in the frequency or Laplace

294
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:10,290
transform domain rather than
in the time domain.

295
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:12,330
And let me just indicate
what the steps

296
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:13,420
are that are involved.

297
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:17,260
And there are a few steps of
algebra that I'll leave in

298
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,480
your hands.

299
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,440
But basically, if we look at
this feedback system, we can

300
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,610
label, of course-- since the
output is y of t, we can label

301
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:31,080
the Laplace transform of
the output as Y of s.

302
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,330
And we also have Y of
s as the input here.

303
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:38,520
Because this is the system
function, the Laplace

304
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:42,620
transform of r of t is simply
the Laplace transform of this

305
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:45,330
input, which is Y of
s times G of s.

306
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:50,410
So here we have Y of
s times G of s.

307
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:55,940
At the adder, the input
here is x of s.

308
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:01,110
And so the Laplace transform of
the error signal is simply

309
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:08,070
x of s minus r of s, which
is Y of s G of s.

310
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:12,440
So this is minus
Y of s G of s.

311
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,580
That's the Laplace transform
of the error signal.

312
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:20,400
The Laplace transform of the
output of this system is

313
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,970
simply this expression
times H of s.

314
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:27,690
So that's what we have here.

315
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:30,820
But what we have here we
already called Y of s.

316
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:35,600
So in fact, we can simply say
that these two expressions

317
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,180
have to be equal.

318
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:41,020
And so we've essentially done
the analysis, saying that

319
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,150
those two expressions
are equal.

320
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:47,440
Let's solve for Y of s over x
of s, which is the overall

321
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,940
system function.

322
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:52,970
And if we do that, what we end
up with for the overall system

323
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:55,820
function is the algebraic
expression

324
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:56,910
that I indicate here.

325
00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:02,840
It's H of s divided by
1 plus G of s H of s.

326
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:07,470
Said another way, it's the
system function in the open

327
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:14,070
loop forward path divided by 1
plus, what's referred to as

328
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:17,150
the loop gain, G of
s times H of s.

329
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,990
Let's just look back up
at the block diagram.

330
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:26,660
G of s times H of s is simply
the gain around the entire

331
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:30,760
loop from this point around
to this point.

332
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,820
So the overall system function
is the gain in the forward

333
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:39,770
path divided by 1 plus the loop
gain, which is H of s

334
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:42,430
times G of s.

335
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:46,540
Now, none of the equations
that we wrote had relied

336
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,490
specifically on this being
continuous-time.

337
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:52,120
We just did some algebra and
we used the system function

338
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,770
property of the systems.

339
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:58,620
And so, pretty obviously, the
same kind of algebraic

340
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:01,990
procedure would work
in discrete-time.

341
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:07,250
And so, in fact, if we carried
out a discrete-time analysis

342
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:11,290
rather than a continuous-time
analysis, we would simply end

343
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:18,600
up with exactly the same system
and exactly the same

344
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:24,600
equation for the overall
system function.

345
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,130
The only difference being that
here things are a function of

346
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:31,840
z, whereas if I just
flip back the other

347
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,880
overlay, we simply have--

348
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,070
previously everything is
function of t and in the

349
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:41,050
frequency domain s.

350
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:45,980
In the discrete-time case, we've
simply replaced in the

351
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:48,920
time domain, the independent
variable by n.

352
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:54,830
And in the frequency domain, the
independent variable by z.

353
00:22:54,830 --> 00:23:02,440
So what we see is that we have a
basic feedback equation, and

354
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,990
that feedback equation is
exactly the same for

355
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:07,590
continuous-time and
discrete-time.

356
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:10,880
Although we have to be careful
about what implications we

357
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,150
draw, depending on whether
we're talking about

358
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,950
continuous-time or
discrete-time.

359
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:24,660
Now, to illustrate the
importance of feedback, let's

360
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:28,750
look at a number of common
applications.

361
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,820
And also, as we talk about these
applications, what will

362
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:36,580
see is that while these
applications and context in

363
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:41,800
which feedback is used are
extremely useful and powerful,

364
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:47,090
they fall out in an almost
straightforward way from this

365
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:52,090
very simple feedback equation
that we've just derrived.

366
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:57,590
Well, the examples that I want
to just talk about are, first

367
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:01,930
of all, the use of feedback
in amplifier design.

368
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:05,980
And we're not going to design
amplifiers in detail, but what

369
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:11,050
I'd like to illustrate is the
basic principle behind why

370
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:14,740
feedback is useful in designing
amplifiers.

371
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:19,840
In particular, how it plays a
role in compensating for a

372
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,640
non-constant frequency
response.

373
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,880
So that's one context that
we'll talk about.

374
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:30,390
A second that I'll indicate
is the use of feedback for

375
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:33,890
implementing inverse systems.

376
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:38,340
And the third, which we
indicated in the case of the

377
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:42,150
inverted pendulum, is an
important context in which

378
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:45,860
feedback is used is in
stabilizing unstable systems.

379
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:52,960
And what we want to see is why
or how a feedback system or

380
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,720
the basic feedback equation, in
fact, let's us do each of

381
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,090
these various things.

382
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:03,140
Well, let's begin with
amplifier design.

383
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:07,960
And let's suppose that we've
built somehow without

384
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:13,380
feedback, an amplifier that is
terrific in terms of its gain,

385
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:17,690
but has the problem that whereas
we might like the

386
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:21,760
amplifier to have a very flat
frequency response, in fact

387
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,200
the frequency response of this
amplifier is not constant.

388
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,290
And what we'd like to do
is compensate for that.

389
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:32,430
Well, it turns out,
interestingly, that if we

390
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:38,250
embed the amplifier in a
feedback loop where in the

391
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:42,640
feedback path we incorporate an
attenuator, then in fact,

392
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,250
we can compensate for that

393
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:46,500
non-constant frequency response.

394
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,910
Well, let's see how that
works out from

395
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:49,990
the feedback equation.

396
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:53,060
We have the basic feedback
equation that we derived.

397
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,900
And we want to look at frequency
response, so we'll

398
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,620
look specifically at the
Fourier transform.

399
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:02,450
And of course, the frequency
response of the overall system

400
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:05,920
is the frequency response of the
Fourier transform of the

401
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,260
output divided by the input.

402
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:11,960
Using the feedback equation that
we had just arrived, that

403
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,430
has, in the numerator, the
frequency response in the

404
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:21,470
forward path divided by 1 plus
the loop gain, which is H of j

405
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,430
omega times k.

406
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:24,920
And this is the key.

407
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:32,830
Because here, if we choose k
times H of j omega to be very

408
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:38,170
large, much larger than 1,
then what happens is that

409
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:41,720
these two cancel out.

410
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:46,380
H of j omega here and in the
denominator will cancel out as

411
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,590
long as this term dominates.

412
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:52,240
And in that case, under that
assumption, the overall system

413
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,650
function is approximately 1/k.

414
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:04,360
Well, if k is constant as a
function of frequency, then we

415
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:08,320
somehow magically have ended up
with an amplifier that has

416
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,210
a flat frequency response.

417
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:14,190
Well, it seems like we're
getting something for nothing.

418
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,840
And actually, we're not.

419
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,850
There's a price that
we pay for that.

420
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:24,110
Because notice the fact that
in order to get gain out of

421
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:29,390
the overall system, k
must be less than 1.

422
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:32,660
So this has to correspond
to attenuator.

423
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:37,680
And we also require that k,
which is less than 1, times

424
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,940
the gain of the original
amplifier, that that product

425
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,340
be greater than 1.

426
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:45,370
And the implication of this,
without tracking it in detail

427
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:49,930
right now, the implication in
this is that whereas we

428
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:53,990
flatten the frequency response,
we have in fact paid

429
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:54,680
a price for that.

430
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:58,030
The price that we've paid is
that the gain is somewhat

431
00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:01,880
reduced from the gain that we
had before the feedback.

432
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:07,710
Because k times h must be much
larger than 1, but the gain is

433
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:09,250
proportional to 1/k.

434
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:12,640
Now, one last point to
make related to that.

435
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,080
One could ask, well, why is it
any easier to make k flat with

436
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:21,920
frequency than to build an
amplifier with a flat

437
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,350
frequency response?

438
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:28,040
The reason is that the gain
in the feedback path is an

439
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,280
attenuator, not an amplifier.

440
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:34,930
And generally, attenuation with
a flat frequency response

441
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:37,460
is much easier to get
than gain is.

442
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:43,820
For example, a resistor, which
attenuates, would generally

443
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,510
have a flatter frequency
response than a

444
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:48,650
very high-gain amplifier.

445
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:52,390
So that's one common example
of feedback.

446
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:57,310
And feedback, in fact, is very
often used in high-quality

447
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:59,210
amplifier systems.

448
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:04,660
Another very common example in
which feedback is used is in

449
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:08,230
implementing inverse systems.

450
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:13,220
Now, what I mean by that is,
suppose that we have a system,

451
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,400
which I indicate
here, P of s--

452
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,250
input and output.

453
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:21,710
And what we would like to do is
implement a system which is

454
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,610
the inverse of this system.

455
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:28,630
Namely, has a Laplace transform
or system function

456
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:31,980
which is 1 over P of s.

457
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:36,640
For example, we may have
measured a particular system

458
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,590
and what we would like
to design is a

459
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:40,140
compensator for it.

460
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,930
And the question is, by putting
this in a feedback

461
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:46,660
loop, can we, in fact,
implement the

462
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,360
inverse of this system?

463
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,580
The answer to that is yes.

464
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,780
And the feedback system,
in that case, is

465
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,900
as I indicate here.

466
00:29:55,900 --> 00:30:01,570
So here what we choose to do
is to put the system whose

467
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:06,050
inverse we're trying to generate
in the feedback loop.

468
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:10,960
And in this case, a high-gain
in the forward path.

469
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,430
Now for this situation, k
is, again, a constant.

470
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:16,970
But in fact, it's a high-gain
constant.

471
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:20,460
And now if we look at the
feedback equation, then what

472
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:24,210
we see is an equation
of this form.

473
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:30,950
And notice that if k times P
of s is large compared with

474
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:35,340
one, then this term dominates.

475
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:38,700
The gain in the forward
path cancels out.

476
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:44,360
And what we're left with is a
system function, which is just

477
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,960
1 over P of s.

478
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,552
And a system of this
type is used in a

479
00:30:51,552 --> 00:30:52,970
whole variety of contexts.

480
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:56,910
One very common one is in
building what are called

481
00:30:56,910 --> 00:31:00,460
logarithmic devices or
logarithmic amplifiers.

482
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:04,730
Ones in which the input-output
characteristic is logarithmic.

483
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:09,260
It's common to do that with a
diode that has an exponential

484
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,630
characteristic.

485
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:14,580
And using that with feedback--

486
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:17,800
as feedback around a high-gain
operational amplifier.

487
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,570
And by the way, the logarithmic

488
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:22,170
amplifier is nonlinear.

489
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:24,440
What I've said here
is linear, or the

490
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,170
analysis here was linear.

491
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:29,790
But that example, in fact,
suggests something which is

492
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:35,750
true, which is that same basic
idea, in fact, can be used

493
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:38,520
often in the context of
nonlinear feedback and

494
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,845
nonlinear feedback systems.

495
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:48,760
Well, as a final example, what
I'd like to analyze is the

496
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:52,520
context in which we
would consider

497
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:56,230
stabilizing unstable systems.

498
00:31:56,230 --> 00:32:00,360
And I had indicated that one
context in which that arises

499
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:06,250
and which we will be analyzing
in the next lecture is the

500
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,930
inverted pendulum.

501
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:12,230
And in that situation, or in
a situation where we're

502
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:16,430
attempting to stabilize an
unstable system, we have now

503
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:22,120
in the forward path a system
which is unstable.

504
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:27,420
And in the feedback path,
we've put an appropriate

505
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:33,000
system so that the overall
system, in fact, is stable.

506
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,480
Now, how can stability arise
out of having an initially

507
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,020
unstable system?

508
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:45,110
Well, again, if we look at the
basic feedback equation, the

509
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:48,690
overall system function is the
system function for the

510
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:52,840
forward path divided by 1
plus the loop gain, G of

511
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,070
s times H of s.

512
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:59,790
And for stability what we want
to examine are the roots of 1

513
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:02,030
plus G of s times H of s.

514
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:08,880
And in particular, the poles are
the zeroes of that factor.

515
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,720
And as long as we choose
G of s, so that the

516
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,490
poles of this term--

517
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:21,700
I'm sorry, so that the zeroes
of this term are in the left

518
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,100
half of the s-plane,
then what we'll

519
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,730
end up with is stability.

520
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:29,530
So stability is dependent not
just on h of s for the

521
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:34,310
closed-loop system, but on 1
plus G of s times H of s.

522
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:40,860
And this kind of notion is used
in lots of situations.

523
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,610
I indicated the inverted
pendulum.

524
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:47,780
Another very common example is
in some very high-performance

525
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:52,910
aircraft where the basic
aircraft system

526
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:55,060
is an unstable system.

527
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:59,800
But in fact, it's stabilized by
putting the right kind of

528
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,530
feedback dynamics around it.

529
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:05,200
And those feedback dynamics
might, in fact, involve the

530
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,870
pilot as well.

531
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:17,790
Now, for the system that we
just talked about, the

532
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:22,520
stability was described
in terms of a

533
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,449
continuous-time system.

534
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:27,540
And the stability condition
that we end up with, of

535
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:32,710
course, relates to the zeroes
of this denominator term.

536
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:36,850
And we require for stability
that the real parts of the

537
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:41,600
associated roots be in the
left half of the s-plane.

538
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,610
Exactly the same kind of
analysis, in terms of

539
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:48,690
stability, applies
in discrete-time.

540
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:55,580
That is, in discrete-time, as
we saw previously, the basic

541
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:58,630
discrete-time feedback system
is exactly the same, except

542
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:02,060
that the independent variable
is now an integer variable

543
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,320
rather than a continuous
variable.

544
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,460
The feedback equation
is exactly the same.

545
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:11,750
So to analyze stability of the
feedback system, we would want

546
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:17,080
to look at the zeroes of 1
plus G of z times H of z.

547
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:21,250
So again, it's those zeroes
that affect stability.

548
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:25,580
And the principal difference
between the continuous-time

549
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:30,550
and discrete-time cases is the
fact that the stability

550
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:35,220
condition in discrete-time is
different than it is in

551
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,030
continuous-time.

552
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:42,270
Namely, in continuous-time, we
care for stability about poles

553
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:46,960
of the overall system being in
the left half of the s-plane

554
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,690
or the right half
of the s-plane.

555
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:53,060
In discrete-time, what we care
about is whether the poles are

556
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:55,420
inside or outside
the unit circle.

557
00:35:55,420 --> 00:36:00,530
So in the discrete-time case,
what we would impose for

558
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:04,390
stability is that the zeroes
have a magnitude which

559
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:06,060
is less than 1.

560
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:12,090
So the basic analysis is the
same, but the details of the

561
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:15,700
stability condition, of
course, are different.

562
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:22,660
Now, what I've just indicated
is that feedback can be used

563
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:27,200
to stabilize an unstable
system.

564
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,660
And as you can imagine there's
the other side of the coin.

565
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:37,120
Namely, if you start with a
stable system and put feedback

566
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:40,300
around it, if you're not careful
what can happen, in

567
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:43,170
fact, is that you can
destabilize the system.

568
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:46,380
So there's always the potential
hazard, unless it's

569
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:50,610
something you want to have
happen, that feedback around

570
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:54,140
what used to be a stable system
now generates a system

571
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,520
which is unstable.

572
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,860
And there are lots of
examples of that.

573
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:01,910
One very common example
is in audio systems.

574
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:04,800
And this is probably an example
that you're somewhat

575
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,880
familiar with.

576
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:12,550
Basically, an audio system, if
you have the speaker and the

577
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:15,980
microphone in any kind of
proximity to each other is, in

578
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:18,190
fact, a feedback system.

579
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:23,590
Well, first of all, the audio
input to the microphone

580
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:31,360
consists of the external audio
inputs, and the external audio

581
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:35,360
inputs might, for example,
be my voice.

582
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,580
It might be the room noise.

583
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:40,140
And in fact, as we'll illustrate
shortly if I'm not

584
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:44,490
careful, might in fact be the
output from a speaker, which

585
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:46,360
represents feedback.

586
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:52,410
That audio, of course, after
appropriate amplification

587
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:56,680
drives a speaker.

588
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:02,730
And if, in fact, the speaker
is, let's say has any

589
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:07,580
proximity to the microphone,
then there can be a certain

590
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:13,200
amount of the output of the
speaker that feeds back around

591
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:18,560
and is fed back into
the microphone.

592
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,200
Now, the system function
associated with the feedback I

593
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:26,280
indicate here as a constant
times e to the minus s times

594
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:30,940
capital T. The e to the minus
s times capital T represents

595
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:36,690
the fact that there is, in
general, some delay between

596
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:41,110
the time delay between the
speaker output and the input

597
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,730
that it generates to
the microphone.

598
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:47,410
The reason for that delay of
course, being that there may

599
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:50,570
be some distance between the
speaker and the microphone.

600
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:54,850
And then the constant K2 that
I have in the feedback path

601
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:57,580
represents the fact that between
the speaker and the

602
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:01,050
microphone, there may
be some attenuation.

603
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:04,970
So if I have, for example, a
speaker as I happen to have

604
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:13,970
here, and I were to have that
speaker putting out what in

605
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:16,120
fact I'm putting into the
microphone, or the output of

606
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:19,640
the microphone, then what we
have is a feedback path.

607
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:23,050
And the feedback path is from
the microphone, through the

608
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:26,990
speaker, out of the speaker,
back into the microphone.

609
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:32,700
And the feedback path is from
here to the microphone.

610
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:36,230
And the characteristics or
frequency response or system

611
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:39,390
function is associated with
the characteristics of

612
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:41,580
propagation or transmission.

613
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:44,440
If I were to move closer to the
speaker and I, by the way,

614
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,825
don't have the speaker
on right now.

615
00:39:46,825 --> 00:39:50,690
And I'm sure you all
understand why.

616
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:58,480
If I move closer, then the
constant K2 gets what?

617
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,750
Gets larger.

618
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:04,040
And if I move further away the
constant K2 gets smaller.

619
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:08,120
Well, let's look at an analysis
of this and see what

620
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:11,020
it is, or why it is, that
in fact we get an

621
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,970
instability in terms--

622
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:15,420
or that an instability is
predicted by the basic

623
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,550
feedback equation.

624
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:20,760
Now, notice first of all, that
we're talking about positive

625
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,160
feedback here.

626
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:27,210
And just simply substituting
the appropriate system

627
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:31,690
functions into our basic
feedback equation, we have an

628
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:35,180
equation that says that the
overall system function is

629
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:38,260
given by the forward gain,
which is the gain of the

630
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:42,040
amplifier between the microphone
and the speaker,

631
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:45,190
divided by 1 minus--

632
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:48,120
and the minus because we have
positive feedback--

633
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:52,350
the overall loop gain, which
is K1, K2, e to the minus s

634
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:58,000
capital T. And these two gains,
K1 and K2 are assumed

635
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,030
to be positive, and generally
are positive.

636
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:06,280
So in order for us to--

637
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:09,620
well, if we want to look at the
poles of the system, then

638
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:12,770
we want to look at the zeroes
of this denominator.

639
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:16,190
And the zeroes of this
denominator occur at values of

640
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:21,000
s such that e to the minus s
capital T is equal to 1 over

641
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,020
K1 times K2.

642
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:28,940
And equivalently that says that
the poles of the closed

643
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:35,260
loop system occur at 1 over
capital T, and capital T is

644
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:37,220
related to the time delay.

645
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:43,460
1 over capital T times the log
to the base e of K1 times K2.

646
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:47,880
Well, for stability we want
these poles to all be in the

647
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,800
left half of the s-plane.

648
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:54,040
And what that means then is
that for stability what we

649
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:59,010
require is that K1 times
K2 be less than 1.

650
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:02,840
In other words, we require that
the overall loop gain be

651
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:06,100
less-- the magnitude of the
loop gain be less than 1.

652
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:09,620
If it's not, then what we
generate is an instability.

653
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:13,990
And just to illustrate that,
let's turn the speaker on.

654
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:18,090
And what we'll demonstrate
is feedback.

655
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:20,340
Right now the system
is stable.

656
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:23,320
And I'm being careful to keep my
distance from the speaker.

657
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:29,090
As I get closer, K2
will increase.

658
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:33,280
And as K2 increases, eventually
the poles will move

659
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,640
into the right half of the
s-plane, or they'll try to.

660
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,060
What will happen is that the
system will start to oscillate

661
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,230
and go into nonlinear
distortion.

662
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:46,350
So as I get closer, you can hear
that we get feedback, we

663
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:48,010
get oscillation.

664
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:53,250
And I guess neither you nor I
can take too much of that.

665
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:58,120
But you can see that
what's happening--

666
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,680
if we can just turn the
speaker off now.

667
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:05,310
You can see that what's
happening is that as K2

668
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:10,660
increases, the poles are moving
on to the j omega axis,

669
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,490
the system starts
to oscillate.

670
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:15,450
They won't actually move into
the right half plane because

671
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:19,650
there are nonlinearities that
inherently control the system.

672
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:31,010
OK, so what we've seen in
today's lecture is the basic

673
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:34,950
analysis equation and a few
of the applications.

674
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:39,960
And one application, or one both
application and hazard

675
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:44,870
that we've talked about, is the
application in which we

676
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:47,170
may stabilize unstable
systems.

677
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:51,580
Or if we're not careful,
destabilize stable systems.

678
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:55,560
As I've indicated at several
times during the lecture, one

679
00:43:55,560 --> 00:44:01,210
common example of an unstable
system which feedback can be

680
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:05,970
used to stabilize is the
inverted pendulum, which I've

681
00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:08,090
referred to several times.

682
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:13,210
And in the next lecture, what
I'd like to do is focus in on

683
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:15,410
a more detailed analysis
of this.

684
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:20,860
And what we'll see, in fact, is
that the feedback dynamics,

685
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:24,760
the form of the feedback
dynamics are important with

686
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:27,750
regard to whether you can and
can't stabilize the system.

687
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:30,630
Interestingly enough, for this
particular system, as we'll

688
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:34,520
see in the next lecture, if you
simply try to measure the

689
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:40,030
angle and feed that back that,
in fact, you can't stabilize

690
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:40,780
the system.

691
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:45,140
What it requires is not only
the angle, but some

692
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,870
information about the rate
of change of angle.

693
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:49,760
But we'll see that in much more

694
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,120
detail in the next lecture.

695
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,370
Thank you.
