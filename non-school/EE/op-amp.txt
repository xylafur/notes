- Has the ability to do many mathematical operations
    - we will examin it as an amplifier

- Differential Amplifier
    - Has two inputs, an output and some gain (positive and negative)

    - What it does
        - takes the two input signals
        - applies the internal gain
        - given an output voltage

    - op amps can't be used as differential amplifiers on their own
        - This is because the natural gain of the OP amp is enormous
            - not quite infinite.. but very big
                - datasheet won't even tell you

            - we have to use negative feedback because the output without any
              extra components is just too big

- Pins
    - positive
        - non inverting input

    - negative
        - inverting input

    - output

    - Positive gain

    - negative gain

- what happens if you just feed input voltage into the input pins
    - the amplifier will amplify the difference between the two inputs
    - the output will be some large constant times the difference

    - this is called the 'open loop' configuration


- How Op amps are useful
    - we need to go from the open loop to adding negative feedback

    - two rules
        - No current flows into or out of the inputs

        - The op amp does whatever it can to keep the two input voltages the
          same
            - (only applies when there is a closed loop)

            - the op amp can't actually change its inputs, but it can change
              them with feedback

- Op amps can amplify both AC and DC

- Op amp buffer circuit

     - rule two applies

          voltage as the non-inverting input

    - the output, and both inputs will all become the same value
        - because of rule number one, nothing will flow in or out of either the
          inputs

        - this is called a high impedance input

        - but it has a low impedance output
            - the output can drive a reasonable amount of current

    - single ended amplifier
        - always referenced to ground

    - what happens
        - the feedback resistor (R2) is always larger than R1

        - there is a volrage divider that feeds back a part of the output to
          the input

    - formula
        Av (gain) = R2 / R1 + 1

    - Virtual Ground
        - the amplifier will try to keep the inputs at the same voltage,
            - since we are connection out non-inverting input to GND

            - the non inverting input will become ground

        - current is forced upward
            - there is 0V at the point where the negative meets the wire that
              ties into the output
            - then there is a voltage drop across R2
                - this forces the signal to drop to a negative voltage
                    - hence the 'inverting' of the inverting amplifier
