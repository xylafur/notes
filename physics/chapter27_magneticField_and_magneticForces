We have learned alot about electricity and electrostatic, so we will now be 
learning about similar concepts for magnets.  There are many things in common,
but many things are different.  

Vectors are used heavily in magnetics

There is a very close relationship between magnetism and electricsatatics
We analyze magnetic field lines differently than electric field lines

A loop rotating in a loop insde of a magnetic field will generate an electric 
field
    windmills, steam turbines, all use this principle to generate electricity

Introduction:
    a compass uses the earth's oriented magnetic field.  The needle on the 
    compass wants to align itself with the magnetic field

    Magnetic forces only effect moving electric charges

    We will see that in the context of magnetism, it is the motion of charges 
    that is crucial.  The faster the charges move the stronger the field


Magnetic Poles:
    Magnets have a north pole and a south pole.  Oposites attract, likes repel
    A permenent magnet will never change its poles.
        An objec that contains iron but is not magnetized is attracted to 
        either pole of a magnet

        There are a few elements which are attracted to magnets

        If you have a polorized object, or an object with some charge, and bring
        something that is neutral close to it, the neutral object will get 
        polarized and become attracted to the poloarized or charged object

Magnetic field of Earth:
    The earth itself is a magnet.
    The magnetic field is strong enough for us to feel it on the surface

    The geographic north pole is close to a magnetic south pole
        this is because the compass north pole points to the earth's south pole

    The earth's magnetic axis is not quite parallel to its geographic axis

    The magnetic field stops alot of em waves from the sun
        the sun produces solar winds, if the earth did not have a magnetic field,
        all of the charged particles that are produced would hit the surface.

Magnetic Monopoles:
    magnetic poles always come in pairs.
    There is no experimental evidence for magnetic monopoles

    Breaking a magnet in 2 yeields two magnets, not isolated poles

We defined an electric field as how a test particle responds or moves.

Electric current and magnets:
    if  a compass is placed on a wire with no current the compass is not effected

    if a current is passed through the wire, we see that the compass needle will 
    move

The magnetic field:
    a moving charge  creates a magnetic field in the surrounding space

    This magnetic field exerts a force on any other moving charge or current 
    that is present in the field

    Like an electric field, a magetic field is a vector field

    The symbol B is used to represent a magnetic field

    The direction of the magnetic field is defined by which way the north pole
    of a compass needle points at that poinut

Magnetic force ona moving charge:
    magnitude magnetic force is prooirtional to the velocity of a moving particle

    the magnetic force is represented as 

    F = qV x B, where both V and B are vectors and x is the cross product
        points purpendicular to velocity and magnetic field

        We can see that magnetic fields only effect moving charges

    the magnitude is 
        F = |q|*v*B*sin(phi)

RIght hand rule for magnetic force:
    gives the direction of the force on a positive charge

    curl fingers from V to B and your thumb points in direction of the force

    if the particle is negative, just reverse the sign of F from what it would be

imagine 2 charges with oposite charges but the same velocity:
    the charges are equal in magnitude but oposite in direction

    The forces they will experience will also be equal in magnitude but opposite

Magnetic Field Lines:
    a magnetic field can be represented by magnetic field lines

    we draw lines so that each line thorugh any point is tangent to the 
    magnetic field vector at that point

    The field lines never intersect.  Very similar to electric field lines

    Lines go out from north pole, into south pole

    Magnetic field lines ALWAYS form closed loops
    The lines are always circular as well, they do not directly go from one 
    pole to the other
        each line completes a loop

    Magnetic field lines are NOT lines of magnetic force
        the force on a charge partice through the field is perpindicular as we
        discussed earlier, given by v x B

How to quantify a magnetic field?

Magnetic field of a straight current carrying wire:
    the magnetic field will form radially (circularly) around the straight wire
    in a direction correlating to right hand rule
        point thumb in direction of current, the way your fingers curl is the
        direction of the field

    Dots represent vectors coming out from plane, x's represent vectors going
    into the plane
