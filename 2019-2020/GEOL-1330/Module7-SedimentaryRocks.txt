- What are they
    - products of mechanical and chemical weathering

    - 5% of earth's upper crust

    - contain evidence of past enviornments

    - important for economic considerations
        - Coal
        - petroleum and gas
        - sources of iron, aluminim and manganese


- 3 major groups of seiments
    - Detrital (Clastic):
        - composted of particles of pre-existing rocks


    - chemical / biochemical rocks
        - precipitated from water, sometimes with aid of marine organisms

    - organic
        - primarily remains of plants and animals


- formations
    1. Chemical and Mechanical Weathering of existing rock
    2. Erioson carries the sediments somewhere else
    3. The sediments all settle to a particular place
    4. The sediment is buried, and more sediment is placed on top
        - Diagenesis


- Agents of Transport
    - mainly wind and water current

    - glaciers are also important in the north

    - currents can mopdify the sediment
        - compositional evolution
            - a group of homogenous minerals can be chemically destroyed by
              currents

            - clays are winnowed away
                - This is winnowing, clay disappears

            - more resistant minerals are carried farther


            - Quartz is the most likely to survive
                - turns into sand
                - sand indicates high intensity weathering

            - Amphiboles and Pyroxenes are the most likeley to disappear and
              turn into clays

        - grain sizes
            - sediment can be well or poorly sorted
                - they become more well sorted over time during transport

            - the more uniform the size of the minerals, the more sorted they
              are

            - factors that affect sorting
                - parent rock
                - currents
                    - less resistant minerals are destroyed
                    - smaller particles are transported further
                    - at the end you might end up with only well sorted quartz sand


        - grain shapes
            - can be more ancular or jagged
                - they become more rounded as they are transported / weathered
                  more


- Sedimentary Environments
    - geographic setting where sediment accumulates
    - influences the nature of sediment

    - non marine (continental)
        - types of deposits
            - fluvial(stream)
                - gravel, sand and mud
                - rounded pebbles
                 - small scale cros bedding

            - lacustrine (lake)
            - paludal (swamp)
            - desert dunes
                - deposits where wind is the main stranporting agent
                - mainly quartz
                    - the rains are frosted
                    - due to abrasion during transport because of very dry
                      climate

            - desert lakes
            - glacial
                - largely unsorted with wide range of sizes
                - many differnt source rocks
                - the glacier just picks up the rock as the ice moves along



    - transitional enviornment
        - beach and barrier island enviornments
            - sediment consisting largely of quartz or carbonate sand
            - well sorted grains

        - deltaic enviornments
            - delta plain
                - sand channels, coal, silt
            - delta front


    - marine environments
        - deposits along the contiental shelf
            - thinly layerd shale and sandstone

        - coral reefs
            - warm marine enviornments


    - deep sea (abyssal) enviornments
        - deep sea fans
            - deep sea avalanches

            - alternating shale and sandstone layers
                - like someone took a chainsaw and did a bunch of parallel
                  slices out of the rock

            - turbidity current
                - form terbidity deposits
                    - the tinest particles are at the bottom


- Sedimentary Facies
    - different sediments often accumulate adjacet to one another at the same
      time

    - each unit has a distinct set of characteristics
        - each of these were accuumulated from the same thing


    - its like a section of sedimentary rocks that form next to eachother

- sedimenary structures
    - sediments can take on a variety of structural / depositional features
        - they are often preserved when changed into sedimentary rock

    - structures can reflect
        - the type of current that deposited the sediments
        - processes occurring in the enviornment


    - Cross Bedding
        - formed by deposition of sediment via wind or water currents

        - bedded material are inclined at angles

        - transported grains are deposited on teh steeper down current slopes

        - basically there is a hill and the sediment gets deposited on the far
          side of the hill
            - this results in the sediment accumulating on the other side


    - graded bedding
        - grains in a sedimentary layer range in size from coarsest at the
          bottom to finsest at the top

        - deposition in deep water on conteintntal slope or deep sea fans

        - they are dropped off by turbidity currents

    - current ripple marks
        - small ridges of sand or silt seperated by wind or water currents

          ////
         ////
        ////


        - symetrical slopes mean current are coming from both directions

        - assymetrical slopes means the current is coming from only one side
            - this happens with desert dunes

    - mud cracks
        - repeated wetting and trying causes mud to dry out and shrink



- Alluvial cycle
    - sediment deposited at the end of a stream

    - the farther from the stream the finer the sediment

    - in the stream itself in the middle you have the large pebbly deposits


- diagensis
    - physical and chemical changes occurring in buried sediments during
      alteration and lithification

    - lithification
        - conversion to sedimentary rock
        - pore fluids crystallize mineral cements

- types of sedimentary rock
    - conglomerate
        - large rocks in the sediemtary rock

    - sandstone
        - formed from sand

    - siltstone
        - from silty mode

    - shale
        - from clay

- changes in sediment during burial
    - grains become squeezed and the stuff is comparted

    - fluids in between the grains is evicted

    - some cementing minerals are precipitate in pore spaces




- classification of clastic sedimentaryt rocks
    - classified based on particle size
        - large particles
            - breccia
                - angular particles

            - comnglomerate
                - rounded particles


        - sandstones (sand)
            - quartz sandstrone
                - if > 90% quartz

            - arkose
                - feldspar rich
                - granite, potassium feldspar

            - lithic sandstone
                - rock fragment rich

            - graywacke
                - clay rich matrix


        - shale (mud)
            - can be broken apart layer by layer

- chemical sedimentary rocks
    - chemical and biochemical sediment
        - certain ions of weathering are transported into large bodies of water

        - dissolved ions eventually precipitated from water by reactions to
          form chemical / biochemical sediment sediment

    - types

        - carobniate sedimentary rocks
            - limestone
                - most abundant chemical rock
                - mostly made of calcite


                - coquina
                    - poorly cemented rock composted largenly of shells

                - chalk
                    - soft porous rock made entirely of hard pars of microscopic
                      marine organisms

                - coral reefs are massive limestone structures that form in warm
                  shallow water


                - inorganic limestone
                    - calcite forms when water becomes supersaturated

                    - we discovered that bacteria plays a part

                - oolitic sediment
                    - small grains are rolled around by waves while accumulating
                      layers of precipitating calcite

            - dolostone
                - composed of the mineral dolomite

                - ways of forming
                    - precipitation of dolomite from evaporating seawater
                    - dolomitizatino of limestone
                        - magnesium rich brines from restricted lagoon seep
                          through underlying carbonate sediments

                            - this turns the limestone into dolomite

                        - brime
                            - body of water saltier than sea water



        - evaporties
            - chemical sedimentary rocks precipitate during evaporation of very
              salty water
                - rock salt (halite crystals)


            - two types of settings
                1.  evaporite basins occur in areas of restricted circulation of
                    seawater
                        - sea water enters a restricted basin
                            - normal sea water is always going in so nothing
                              can go out

                        - just the water evaporates so all of the dissolved
                          ions stay behind in the water


                        - just because the brime is so ion rich, when the water
                          disappears the ions form into a solid substance

                2.  supertidal deposition occurs slightly above high tide
                    - you have some rock with cracks that salt water washes
                      over

                    - the water evaporates and then these evaporites are left
                      behind

        - siliceous (quartz)
            - formed mostly from microcrystalline quartz

            - bedded chert
                - accumulates on the seafloor as layers of tiny silica
                  skeletons of diatoms and radiolarians

                - layers of silica in rock cavities

            - nodular chert
                - form silica rich fluids in rock cavities or through
                  alteration of carbonate rock

            - geodes
                - limestone with a cavity
                - groundwater goes into a cavity inside of the limestone
                - this forms the geode overtime


        - organics
            - coal
                - starts out as a swamp
                - the swamp becomes buried, forming all this stuff

                PEAT -> LIGNITE -> BITUMINOUS -> ANTHRACITE

                - bitumunous is the kind of coal that we use mostly
                    - much more abundant than anthracite

    - biochemical sediments
        - hard parts of organisms and biologically precipitated minerals

        - usually composed of calcuim carbonite
        - can also be silica


        - bioclastic particles
            - shells or shell fragments
            - coprolites
                - excrement fossils

            - eventually these are cemented together to form limestone
