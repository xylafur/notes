- What is an earthquake?
    - vibration of earth due to rapid release of energy

    - energy is released from the source, the hypocenter
        - the hypocenter is the area within the fault where the original fault slippage occurs

    - Elastic Rebound Theory
        - fault plane is initially at rest
        - as force is applied, the fault is locked and resists movement
        - eventually the fault slips, releasing energy


    - Not the entire fault splits
        - the earth quake begins at the hypocenter


    - Foreshock
        - minor earthquakes which happen before an earthquake
        - happen as strain build up along fault plane

    - Aftershock
        - other small earthquakes that happen after the main one
        - happen as the fault readjusts
