- Continental Drift
    - Continents as pieces of a jigsaw puzzle
    - map makers in the 1600s began to realize that the continents kinda fit together



    - there are mountain reidges against the west sides of africa and europe as
      well as the east side of america

    - Alfred Wegener
        - proposed his continental drift theory in 1915

        - no one believed him though
            - the hypothesis lacked a viable mechanism


        - more evidence eventually came out to support this
            - fossils from the same animals and plants on different continents
            - geologic matches on the areas that were assumed to have fit
              together

            - ancient climate
                - glaciers
                    - when ice flows over bedrock, the bedrock is broken into
                      smaller pieces and gets sucked up into the ice

                    - eventually these sediments are deposited
                        - these are in particular places and we can now see that
                          the glaciers were at this place at one time

                    - we find glacial deposits in places that are now deserts

                    - there are groves that are carved, these grooves can tell us
                      the direction of the glacer flow

                - Ancient rocks and fossils that do not match the cliamate of
                  their current locations

                - paleomagnetism
                    - study of magnetic properties of ancient rocks

                    - two components of magnetization
                        - declination:
                            - horizontal swing

                            - the rotational position of the compass needle

                            - points tot he magnetic north pole

                        - inclination
                            - tilt of magnetism

                            - the horizonal tilt of the compass needle, like a
                              seesaw

                            - the angle that the compass needle makes with the
                              earth's surface
                                - this is a function of latitude

                                - this is parallel at the equator


                    - particular sedimentary rocks can aquire magnitization
                        - these become aligned with earth's magnetic field
                        - so this records the direction of earth's magnetic
                          field at the time the rock was created


                        - This can also happen with lava!
                            - magnetic materials in volcanic rocks record the
                              direction of Earth's magnetic field atht the time
                              the lava crystallized



    - Seafloor Spreading
        - after WW2 we had sonar technology to map the sea floor
            - what we saw provided even more evidence of continental drift

        - Nowadays we use satellite altimetrey to measure the sea floor height

        - the seafloor has complex bathymetry
            - deep trenches
            - immense fracture zones
            - huge underwater mountain ranges call mid-ocean ridges


        - Mid ocean ridges
            - they extend the length of entire ocean basin

            - sites of submarine seismic erruptions (volcanicly active)

            - heated seawater is discharged from these ridges
                - these are called black smokers because the heated sea water
                  looks like black smoke


        - Oceanic Lithosphere (from bottom to top)
            - Mantle
                - Peridotites

            - Dividing line called Moho

            - Oceanic Crust
                - Gabbros
                    - layerd rocks from the crystallisation in the magma
                      chamber

                - Sheeted Dikes
                    - these come to a head with "pillow lavas"

                - Pillow Basalts
                    - basicallty a bunch of rounded tops of these rocks

            - Ocean Sediments
                - deep sea sediments

- video 2
    - Iceland is right on top of a mid ocean ridge
        - or rather the ridge comes up on land

        - all of the rocks are bssalt rocks
            - these are a volcanic rock


    - okay so continental drift is a thing, but why?
        - this guy in the 60's took on this idea of some earlier guy about
          convection motion inside of the mantle

            - basically the mantle is circulating and that is causing crust on
              top of it to move

            - convection cells causing litosperic plates to move


        - Convection cells spread apart under mid ocean ridges
            - then they go our from here in each directions

            - so plates are moving away from mid ocean ridges

            - This causes new oceanic crust to be formed along the mid ocean
              ridges

        - Even though continental drift was accepted in the 1930s, we didn't knowS
          why it was happening
            - in the 60s it was sugested that there are convective flows in the
              mantle

            - There is a circulating mantle that is parting at a upwelling and
              causing the crust on top of them to move


            - Mantle convection cells rise beneath mid ocean rideges
                - from this they spread apart


            - there is a magma chamber right below the mid ocean rideges
                - this creates new oceanic crust

                - the crust right over the ridge is much higher because the heated
                  material is much less dense and more boyant
                    - as you go farther away from the upwelling it is lower and
                      lower because it has hardened and is more dense

                    - so the farther from a mid ocean ridge, the lower the ocean
                      floor


    - Transform fault boundaries
        - Plates can slide past eachother
            - so there is no creation or distruction along these faults

        - the mid-ocean ridge can be split into multiple sections

            - there are many transform faults along mid ocean ridges because of
              offsets in the faults

            - so two plates are pulling appart but there are transform
              boundaires all withing this divergent boundary

    - Mantle Plumes
        - long lived structures

        - originate at te core-mantle boundary

        - hot plumes are boyant and float up to the crust

        - this is a hot spot and can form volcanoes on the surface

        - this can cause a chain of volcanic islands as the crust on top moves
          past the plume

            - so the plume will create an island over time and then the crust
              will move and a new island will be formed in the new location

    - Age of crust
        - the crust is the yuongest right next to mid ocean ridges (where it is
          created)
        - the crust is oldest farthest away from the ridges
            - it truncates against the continents


    - Sediment
        - the farther you get from the ridge, the more sediment that has
          accumulated on top of the ocean crust


- Seafloor Magnetic Anomaly Patterns
    - discussing megnetic polarity reversals

    - so we know that magnetic materials in rocks can be aligned with the
      magnetic field (in cooling magma)

        - if we look at cooled lava from ~800000 years ago, the lava flow
          indicates that the magnetic field was on the other side of the planet

- Formation of an Ocean Basin (this is called the Wilson Cycle)
    - We have a continental crust of one continuous plate

    - underneath there is an upwelling of hot mantle material
        - this results in warping above on the continent or whatever

        - as this continues, a rift valley is created across the continent
            - this is called the continental rift

    - the continents seperate evenyuall as the mantle plume continues
        - this forms a linear sea

    - oceanic crust begins to form above the mantle plume
        - there is a spreading mid ocean ridge and a rift valley


    - there is a continental shelf that leads in further to the ocean
        - eventualy the heignt of the crust drops significantly as the
          continental crust disappears and the oceanic crust is the only thing
          left

    - There is continental crust on either side, and oceanic crust in the
      middle
        - passive continental margins do not occur along plate boundaries
            - these are not plate boundaries, they are passive

            - it is just a drop off of continental crust
                (see figure 2.1)

        - there is a continental shelf against the deeper water depths

            - this is a very quick drop off point

        - farther on there is a dramatic change in height, called the shelf
          break
            - there is sediment here that has been acumulating over many years


        - then further down, we see a very gradual sinking of crust height,
          this is called the continental slope
            - this is still continental crust!

        - Then we have a very level, low part called the continental rise
            - this is the transition to oceanic crust


        - Deep- sea fans
            - contintal crust sediment that has been carried



- Seafloor flattens out at the continental rise
    - there is a distinct boundary between the continental and oceanic crust

    - there is a continental shelf on which the continent (and ocean next to
      the continent) sits


- East African (Afar) Triple Junction
    - Upwelling mantle plume in Africa

    - this causes the lithosphere splin into three arms


    - this has created two Modern Day Linear Sea (linear sea) s
        - The Red Sea
            - divergent plate boundary
            - becomes a transform plate boundary more north
                - this is why there are alot of earthquakes in the bible

        - The gulf of Aden

    - the third arm is a failed rift, known as the east african rift system

- Video 3
    - East africa tripple junction is a good place to see the wilson cycle
        - we have an upwelling mantle plume here against the base of the
          lithosphere

        - this is plitting the lithosphere into 3 arms

            - 2 of these arms form the aden gulf and red sea
                - in the northern part of the red sea there is a transform
                  boundary
                    - the rest of the red sea is a divergent boundary

            - there is also a failed rift called the african rift system
                - it is volcanically active, even though it is not a sea yet
                - mount kenya, mount kellamenjaro (kilimanjero)


    - Types of plate boundaries
        - divergent (constructive)
            - mainly mid ocean ridges

        - convergent (destructive)
            - two plates collide with one possibly subducting beneath the other

        - Transform (lithosphere is conserved)
            - Two plates slide laterally past eachother


        - volcanoes and earthquakes mostly happen along plate boundaries
            - most volcanoes are along convergent plate boundaries

    - Parts of the subduction zone
        - Trench, Accretionary Wedge, and Forearc Basinn
            - almost all convergent boundaries have these

        - Trench
            - deep depression on the sea floor whree oceanic plate bends down

            - sediments and pices scapre off and accumulate as an accretionaryt
              wedge

            - when the subducting plate reaches a particular depth in the
              mantle it generates magma that then rises towards the surface

              (figure 2.2)

        - Forearc Basin



    - Thress types of convergent plate boundaries
        - Ocean-Ocean
            - this can create volcanic island arcs
            - the volcanoes all appear as individual volcanoes

            - Example
                - Aleutian Islands between russia and Alaska

                - the north american plate is the one on top

        - Ocean-continent
            - oceanic goes under continental crust
                - still have the 3 parts:
                    - trench, forearc basin, acretiancy prism (the ridge thing)

            - There are continental volcanic arcs
                - these create volcanoes and mountains on top of teh magma
                  chambers

            - Other examples
                - Andes mountains of south america
                    - uplift of continental crust and volcanoes

                - along the juan de fuca plate
                    - along washington and oregon

                    - The sawtooth image along the juan de fuca plate is how a
                      convergent plate is represented (Figure 2.3)
                        - the teeth point in the direction of the subducting
                          plate

                        - there is a mendocino fault right next to the juan de
                          fuca plate, causing the juan de fuca plate to do this


                        - the volcanoes formed by this are the cascades (mount
                          saint hellens is an example)

        - Continent-Continent
            - Collision between india and Asia
                - causes earthquake in china

                - india used to be its own continent and eventually collided
                  with asia

                - this formed the himalayas
                    - contientnal crust

                - this turned tibet into a plateau


    - Collage Tectonics
        - assemblage of micro continents, arcs and other crustal fragments
          accreted along the edge of a continenta adjacent to a subduction zone
            - basically a bunch of micro contrinents keep dog piling eachother
            - (Figure 2.4)

            - this happens along the edge of a continent
                - there is subducting oceanic lithosphere going uinder the
                  continent
                    - this causes an encroching microcontinent or island change
                      to impact with the islands and just stack on it

                  - this forms a new subduction zone, then it can happen again
                    and again


        - Example
            - Mt. McKinley Alaska

            - Chulitna Terrane, Alaska
                - alaska is 100% acreted terraigns


            - appalacia


    - What drives plate tectonics?
        - Other thean mantle convection
        - these are all just ideas (well I guess so is mantle convection)

        - mantle drag
            - enhances plate motion when the velocity of the athenosphere
              exceeds that of the plate

        - Slab Pull
            - cooling lithosphere thickens and is very dense / heavy
            - this pulls down cold sinking lithosphere further into the mantle
            - this can be impeaded by mantle drag

        - ridge push
            - gravity driven force
            - gravity pulls down new oceanic plate down the side of a mid ocean
              ridge (this is why its lower farther away, or because of)

        - whole mantle convection
            - the whole mantle is undergoing convection
            - there are rising plumes from the core that casuse all ofthe
              mantle convection

            - subducting oceanic lithosphere sinks all the way into the core of
              the planet crust
                - this melts and turns into a hot plume that then goes back to
                  the surface

        - layer cake convection model
            - the lower and upper mantle are isolated, it is the upper mantle
              that does all of the convection / mantle plumes and stuff


            - sinking crust pieces go only to the bottom of the upper mantle
