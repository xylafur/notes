- Continental Drift
    - Continents as pieces of a jigsaw puzzle
    - map makers in the 1600s began to realize that the continents kinda fit together



    - there are mountain reidges against the west sides of africa and europe as
      well as the east side of america

    - Alfred Wegener
        - proposed his continental drive throughy in 1915

        - no one believed him though
            - the hypothesis lacked a viable mechanism


        - more evidence eventually came out to support this
            - fossils from the same animals and plants on different continents
            - geologic matches on the areas that were assumed to have fit
              together

            - ancient climate
                - glaciers
                    - when ice flows over bedrock, the bedrock is broken into
                      smaller pieces and gets sucked up into the ice

                    - eventually these sediments are deposited
                        - these are in particular places and we can now see that
                          the glaciers were at this place at one time

                    - we find glacial deposits in places that are now deserts

                    - there are groves that are carved, these grooves can tell us
                      the direction of the glacer flow

                - Ancient rocks and fossils that do not match the cliamate of
                  their current locations

                - paleomagnetism
                    - study of magnetic properties of ancient rocks

                    - two components of magnetization
                        - declination:
                            - horizontal swing

                            - the rotational position of the compass needle

                            - points tot he magnetic north pole

                        - inclination
                            - tilt of magnetism

                            - the horizonal tilt of the compass needle, like a
                              seesaw

                            - the angle that the compass needle makes with the
                              earth's surface
                                - this is a function of latitude

                                - this is parallel at the equator


                    - particular sedimentary rocks can aquire magnitization
                        - these become aligned with earth's magnetic field
                        - so this records the direction of earth's magnetic
                          field at the time the rock was created


                        - This can also happen with lavea:!
                            - magnetic materials in volcanic rocks record the
                              direction of Earth's magnetic field atht the time
                              the lava crystallized



    - Seafloor Spreading
        - after WW2 we had sonar technology to map the sea floor
            - what we saw provided even more evidence of continental drift

        - Nowadays we use satellite altimetrey to measure the sea floor height

        - the seafloor has complex bathymetry
            - deep trenches
            - immense fracture zones
            - huge underwater mountain ranges call mid-ocean ridges


        - Mid ocean ridges
            - they extend the length of entire ocean basis

            - sites of submarine seismic erruptions (volcanicly active)

            - heated seawater is discharged from these ridges
                - these are called black smokers because the heated sea water
                  looks like black smoke


        - Oceanic Lithosphere (from bottom to top)
            - Mantle
                - Peridotites

            - Dividing line called Moho

            - Oceanic Crust
                - Gabbros
                    - layerd rocks from the crystallisation in the magma
                      chamber

                - Sheeted Dikes
                    - these come to a head with "pillow lavas"

                - Pillow Basalts
                    - basicallty a bunch of rounded tops of these rocks

            - Ocean Sediments
                - deep sea sediments

    - okay so continental drift is a thing, but why?
        - this guy in the 60's took on this idea of some earlier guy about
          convection motion inside of the mantle

            - basically the mantle is circulating and that is causing crust on
              top of it to move
            
            - convection cells causing litosperic plates to move


        - Convection cells spread apart under mid ocean ridges
            - then they go our from here in each directions

            - so plates are moving away from mid ocean ridges


            - This causes new oceanic crust to be formed along the mid ocean
              ridges


    - Transform fault boundaries
        - Plates can slide past eachother
            - so there is no creation or distruction along these faults

        - the mid-ocean ridge can be split into multiple sections

            - there are many transform faults along mid ocean ridges because of
              offsets in the f


    - Mantle Plumes
        - long lived structures

        - originate at te core-mantle boundary

        - hot plums are boyant and float up to the crust

        - this is a hot spot and can form volcanoes on the surface


        - this can cause a chain of volcanic islands as the crust on top moves
          past the plume

            - so the plume will create an island over time and then the crust
              will move and a new island will be formed in the new location

    - Age of crust
        - the crust is the yuongest right next to mid ocean ridges (where it is
          created)
        - the crust is oldest farthest away from the ridges
            - it truncates against the continents


    - Sediment
        - the farther you get from the ridge, the more sediment that has
          accumulated on top of the ocean crust


    


- Seafloor Magnetic Anomaly Patterns
    - discussing megnetic polarity reversals

    - so we know that magnetic materials in rocks can be aligned with the
      magnetic field (in cooling magma)

        - if we look at cooled lava from ~800000 years ago, the lava flow
          indicates that the magnetic field was on the other side of the planet



- Formation of an Ocean Basin
    - We have a continental crust of one continuous plate

    - underneath there is an upwelling of hot mantle material
        - as this continues, a rift valley is created

    - the continents seperate evenyuall as the mantle plume continues

    - oceanic crust begins to form above the mantle plume


    - there is a continental shelf that leads in further to the ocean
        - eventualy the heignt of the crust drops significantly as the
          continental crust disappears and the oceanic crust is the only thing
          left
