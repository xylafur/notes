- Continental Drift
    - Continents as pieces of a jigsaw puzzle
    - map makers in the 1600s began to realize that the continents kinda fit together



    - there are mountain reidges against the west sides of africa and europe as
      well as the east side of america

    - Alfred Wegener
        - proposed his continental drive throughy in 1915

        - no one believed him though
            - the hypothesis lacked a viable mechanism


        - more evidence eventually came out to support this
            - fossils from the same animals and plants on different continents
            - geologic matches on the areas that were assumed to have fit
              together

            - ancient climate
                - glaciers
                    - when ice flows over bedrock, the bedrock is broken into
                      smaller pieces and gets sucked up into the ice

                    - eventually these sediments are deposited
                        - these are in particular places and we can now see that
                          the glaciers were at this place at one time

                    - we find glacial deposits in places that are now deserts

                    - there are groves that are carved, these grooves can tell us
                      the direction of the glacer flow

                - Ancient rocks and fossils that do not match the cliamate of
                  their current locations

                - paleomagnetism
                    - study of magnetic properties of ancient rocks

                    - two components of magnetization
                        - declination:
                            - horizontal swing

                            - the rotational position of the compass needle

                            - points tot he magnetic north pole

                        - inclination
                            - tilt of magnetism

                            - the horizonal tilt of the compass needle, like a
                              seesaw

                            - the angle that the compass needle makes with the
                              earth's surface
                                - this is a function of latitude

                                - this is parallel at the equator


                    - particular sedimentary rocks can aquire magnitization
                        - these become aligned with earth's magnetic field
                        - so this records the direction of earth's magnetic
                          field at the time the rock was created


                        - This can also happen with lavea:!
                            - magnetic materials in volcanic rocks record the
                              direction of Earth's magnetic field atht the time
                              the lava crystallized



    - Seafloor Spreading
        - after WW2 we had sonar technology to map the sea floor
            - what we saw provided even more evidence of continental drift

        - Nowadays we use satellite altimetrey to measure the sea floor height

        - the seafloor has complex bathymetry
            - deep trenches
            - immense fracture zones
            - huge underwater mountain ranges call mid-ocean ridges


        - Mid ocean ridges
            - they extend the length of entire ocean basis

            - sites of submarine seismic erruptions (volcanicly active)

            - heated seawater is discharged from these ridges
                - these are called black smokers because the heated sea water
                  looks like black smoke


        - Oceanic Lithosphere (from bottom to top)
            - Mantle
                - Peridotites

            - Dividing line called Moho

            - Oceanic Crust
                - Gabbros
                    - layerd rocks from the crystallisation in the magma
                      chamber

                - Sheeted Dikes
                    - these come to a head with "pillow lavas"

                - Pillow Basalts
                    - basicallty a bunch of rounded tops of these rocks

            - Ocean Sediments
                - deep sea sediments
