- Rock Deformations
    - Horizontally Layered rocks can be tilted or deformed by tectonic forces
        - folds
            - twists and bends in rocks

        - joints
            - fractures in rocks

        - faults
            - rocks on one side of dislocation displaced relatve to rocks on the other side

    - Structural Geology
        - study of the architecture and processes responsible for deformation

    - Deformation
        - general term that referes to all changes in the original form and or size of a rock body


    - Stress
        - force applied to a given area
        - 3 types of differential stress
            - compressional Stress
                - squeezs and shortens a body

            - Tensional Stress
                - stretches the body and pulls it apart

            - Shearing Stress
                - pushes different parts of a body in opposite directions
        
        - strain
            - changes in the shape or size of a rock body caused by stress

            - as a result rocks subjected to stresses will deform by folding or fracturing


    - Characteristics of Deformation
        - elastic deformation
            - rock returns to nearly its original size and shape when the stress is removed

            - once the elastic limit of a rock is met, the rock either fractures (brittle
              deformation) or flows (ductile deformation)


    - What determines how rocks form
        - confining pressure
            - at shallower depths (less pressure) there is more faulting

        - temp
            - brittle at lower temp
            - ductile at higher temp

        - Rock Type

        - Time
            - the longer the stress is applied, the more likely the rock will deform


    - Strike and Dip
        - units of measuring deformation

        - strike
            - the direction of a line formed by the intersecion of a rock layer with a
              horizoinal plane


            - it is a compass direction

        - dip
            - measured at right angle with the strike

            - measures the andle at which the rock layer tilts relative to the horizonal plane

            - can also be though of as the direction water would flow down the rock

            - always an accute angle

        - strike and dip are measured using a brunken compass


    - Folds
        - folds result from ductile deformation of rocks in reponse to external forces

        - anticlines
            - layered rocks that were folded into arches
            - Oldest strata occurs along the hinge line

        - synclines
            - layered rocks folded into troughs
            - youngest strata occurs along the hing line

- Domes and Basins
    - strata exposted at the top form circles around a central point

    - Dome
        - anticlinal structure
        - flanking strata encircle a central point and dip away from it in all directions

        - the oldest strata is at the center, at the top

    - Basin
        - Synclinal structure
        - bowl shapped depression

        - rock layers dip toward central point

        - youngest formations are in the middle

- Folds
    - Plunging Folds
        - occurs when the hinge line is not horizontal and the fold appears to plunge into the
          ground

    - Symmetrical Fold
        - Axial Plane is Vertical
        - Beds dip at about the same angle but in opposite directions

    - Asymmetrical Fold
        - Axial Plane is Inclined
        - limbs dip in opposite directions but at different angles

    - Overturned Fold
        - eventually a fold can overturn or flip onto its side

        - axial plane is steeply inclined
        - both limbs dip in same direction but at different angles

    - Recumbent Fold
        - the fold just lays down on the axial plane

- Joints and Faults
    - rocks that undergo brittle deformation tend to fracture into joints and faults

    - Joints
        - cracks or splits in a rock where no appreciable movement has occured

    - A fault plane divides a rock into two blocks
        - Hanging Wall
            - block of rock that occurs above an inclined fault plane

        - Footwall
            - block of rock below the inclined fault plane


    - Faults
        - plane of dislocation where rocks on one side have moved relative to rocks on the other
          side

        - you will see offset layers between two sides of a fault

        - result from brittle deformation in response to any of the three types of stresses
        - the type of fault produced depends on the type of stress


        - types
            - dip slip faults
                - movement of blocks is primarilly parallel to the dip of the fault plane

            - normal fault
                - result of tensional stress
                - hanging wall slips downward relative to slipwall

                - commonly form in rift valleys

            - reverse fault
                - caused by compressional stress
                - hanging wall moves upward with respect to footwall

            - Differences between Reverse and Thrust Faults
                - for both types the hanging wall moves upward relative to footwall

                - Reverse Faults
                    - Fault angles greater than 45o
                    - generally small
                    - accommodate local displacements

                - Thrust Faults
                    - fault angles > 45o
                    - can accommodate large displacements (10s to 100s of km)

            - thrust faults

        - Stripe Slick Faults
            - fault movement is primarily horizontal
                - one rock slips horizontally past another rock

            - transform faults
