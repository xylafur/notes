- Metamorphic rocks have undergone one or more of
    - changes in mineralogy
    - texture
    - chemical composition

- Metamoric rocks are created between temperatures of 200 and 700 C

- Metamorphic Reactions
    - many metamorphic reactions occur in the precnce of fluids

    - original rocks can be any kind of rock

    - Agents of Metamprish
        - heat (the most important agent)
        - pressure (particularly stress)
        - chemically active fluids


    - Heat
        - Two sources of heat
            - magma
            - increase of temperature with depth
                - this is called the Earth's geothermal gradient

        - Isotherm
            - line of equal temperature in a diagram

            - rising magma from the earth's crust can increase the geothermal gradient over a
              particular part of land
                - this will metamprpize shallow rock

            - within a sedimentary basin
                - can result in metamorphic conditions at the very bottom of the pile

            - 300 C
                - subducting sediments are metamorphised due to increased temp and pressure

            - 600 C
            - 900 C
            - 1200 C

    - pressure and metamorphissm
        - two types of pressure
            - confining pressure
                - stress is applied equally in all directions
                - same direction, same magnitude

                - the strata in the rock is very flat
                    - the rock is made up of equal layers 

            - differential stress
                - stress is applied unequally

                - stress is usually greatest in a single direction

                - the stratta is all over the place


    - Fluids and metamorphism
        - water is the main fluid
            - there are other volatile components in the water

        - fluids enhance migration of ions
            - this aids in the recrystalization of existing minerals

        - can transport mineral matter a considerable distance


        - sources of chemically active fluids
            - local
                - port spaces of sedimentary rocks
                - fractures in igneous rocks
                - hidrated minerals like clays

            - regional
                - gysers


    - parent rock
        - determins to a large extent how which ever metamorphic agent changes the rock
        - metamorphic rocks have very similar chemical composition to their parent rocks




- Types of Metamorphism
    - contact metamrphism
        - occurs at high termperatures
        - restricted tothe area right afound a magmatic intrusion
        - the rock produced depends on the parent


        - produces a "zone of alteration" called an aureole
            - preserved after the magma chamber of a volcano turns into a pluton

    - Hydrothermal metamorpism
        - occurs along mid-ocean ridges
            - heated seat water gets through

        - occurs when cold seawater percolates into hot newly formed oceanic crust
            - the water is heated and then ion rich minerals are absorbed

        - this can also occur on continents
            - deep seated magma chambers or gysers or hot springs

    - burial metamorphism
        - sedimentary rocks are just buried to lower and lower depts

        - results in partial alteration of minerals and texture
            - often original sedimentary structures are preserved though

    - Regional metamorphism
        - temps and pressures increase beyond range of burial metamorphism

        - results in intense alteration of rock mineralogy and texture

        - closing ocean ocean basin
            - most likely way in which regoinal metamorphism happens

    - Cataclastic Metamorphism
        - crushing and shearing of rocks during tectonic movement

        - happens along fault planes
            - when happen at shallow depths
                - fault breccia

            - greater depths
                - mylonites
                - this is a sheared and highly deformed structure

    - impact metamorphism
        - when high speed projectiles (meteors) strike earths surface

        - the impact pulverizes, shatters and melts roc


- Metamorphic Facies
    - describe groupings of rocks formed under different temperatures and pressures

    - encompass different regions of the "temperature-pressure space"

    - the facies are named after certain charactericic minerals formed through the metamorphism of
      basalt


    - types
        - zerolite
            - low temperature, low pressure
                - < 4kb, <250 C

            - very low grade metamorphism
            - associated with burial and hydrothermal matamorphism

            - very bottom of sedimentary basins

        - greenschist
            - moderate temperature, moderature pressure
                - 2 - 9 kb, 250 - 250 C

            - Low grade metamprhism

                - pyroxene granulites are produces
                    - has calcium rich plagioclase

        @@@@@@@@@@
        @ You can imagine all of the prvious being layers of a mountain


        - blueschist
            - low temperature, high pressure
            - happens within shallower parts subduction zones
            - bluish color

        - eclogite
            - extreme pressure, moderate high temp
            - happens deep in subduction zone
            - produces garnets and pyroxenes

        @@@@@@@@@@
        @ The previous 2 both happen within subduction zones


        - hornfels
            - low pressures, wide range of higher temperatures

            - usually contact metamorphism
                - the most likely place for C.M. to happen is the crustial portion of a volcanic
                  range

- Metamorphic Textures and Foliation
    - Texture is the size shape an arrangment of mineral grains
    - Foliation is any planar arangments of grains or structural features in a rock
        - shows up as parallel alignments of mineral grains or pebbles
        - can also see banding (alternating light and dark layers)


    - How foliation forms
        - rotation of platy or elongated minerals

        - recrystalization of minerals in teh direction of preffered orientation


        - process
            - have a bunch of grains that are round and packed kinda right
            - the grains are deformed by slippage along planes
            - then the grains are flattened and packed tighter together

        - pregression over depth
            - at margins of mountain belt (low grade metamorphism)
                - shale has converted into a rock called slate
                - the loosely packed grains from shale have been tightly packed

                - parallel alighment of mica and chlorite in slate

                - forms slaty cleavage

            - A bit deeper in ght mountain root (upper low grade metamorphism)
                - mica flakes in slate are bent and form phylite

                - phyllite is a shiny mineral

                - minerals ave grown largert

            - even deeper (medium grade metamorphism)
                - the phyllite turns into shist

                - the mica grains have been recrystalized

                - an even greater increase in size of minerals

                - the minerals are not clearly visable to the naked eye

            - even deeper! (high grade metamophism)
                - shist convverts into gneiss

                - bands of light and dark minerals

                - mafic minerals
                    - biotite, amphiboles (dark bands)
                - felsic
                    - quartz and feldspar (light bands)

            - eeeeeven deeper (regional metamorhism)
                - temperatures here are > 700C
                - Gneiss partially melts and forms migmatite
                    - only the felsic minerals really melt

                - the softened rock i bent and becomes these wavy bands



- Slaty Cleavage
    - closely spaced planar surfaces along which rocks split into thin slabs
    - forms through low grade metamprhpism of shale to slate under differential stress
    - the resulting alignement of the minerals produces thin layers over which the mineral splits



- metamorphism of mafic igneous rocks
    - chlorite, tale, serpentine, amphibole, pyroxene can form from mafic metamorphism


    - subducting plate metamorphism
        - low T, high P
            - greenshist

        - hight T, high P
            - Eclogite

    - Amphibolites
        - Metamorphic rocks formed under medium grade metamorphism of mafic ignesous

        - have long thin amphibolite minerals aligned in a common direction


- Non foliated metamorphic rocks
    - little or no differential stress
        - contact metamorphism
        - hydrothermal metamorphism

    - can also happen because of a lack of platy minerals

    - minerals formed
        - quartzite
            - metamorphism of quartz sandstone

        - marble
            - metamorphism of limestone

        - Hornfels
            - formed by contact metamorphism of mudstones and shales


- 7 rocks that we need to learn
    - Slate
    - Phylite
    - Shist
    - Gneiss
    - Marble
    - Quartzite
    - Hornfels


    [ figure8.1 ]


- Metamorphic Zones and Index Minerals
    - index minerals are good indicators of the metamorphic conditions under which they are formed

        - metamorphism of shale produces several usefult index minerals

    - Aluminum-Silicate Minerals are good indicators of pressure and temperature of metamorphism


THe following figure is very good to wrap all of this up together!
[ figure8.2 ]


- micas are the most visual aspect of foliated metamorphic rocks
