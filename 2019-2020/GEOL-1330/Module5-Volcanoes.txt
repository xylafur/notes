- Notable Volcanic Eruptions
    - Mount Vesuvius
        - Italy
        79 AD

    - Mt Tambora
        - Indonesia

        - enough stuff was thrown into the atmosphre was thrown into the air
          above indonesia that sun was not able to get completley though and
          resulted in crop failures


    - Krakatoa
        - Indonesia
        - 1883

        - Generated tsunamis

        - so loud that it was heard over 3000 miles away

        - Gerupted in a series of pyroclastic flows
            - pyroclastic flows: Avalanches of hot volcanic ash and gas


    - My Pinatubo
        - Philippenes
        - 1991

- The nature of volcanic eruptions
    - the characteristics of a magma
        - determine the violence (or explosiveness) of a volcanic eruption

    - Viscosity
        - measure of a material's resistance to flow

        - factors
            - Composition
            - temperature
            - amount of dissolved gasses


        - factors which effect
            - temperature
                - higher temperature are less viscous and flow more

            - composition
                - high silica content means high viscosity

            - volitiles (dissolved gases)
                - dissolved water increases the fluidity


            - Violence of an eruption is related to how easily gases escape from
              magma


        - Basaltic Lava
            - High Temperature Melts (1000 - 1200 C)

            - Relatively low silica

            - Very Fluid


            - hardens into:
                - olivine, pyroxine, calcium rich paraclase
                - basalt


            - subtypes
                - pahoehoe lava
                    - ropey texture


                - Aa Lava
                    - rough, jagged blocky texture


            - Dissolved gases are mainly H20 and C02



        - Rhyolitic Lava
            - Erupts at lower temperatures

            - contains more silica

            - more viscus than Basalt

            - Crystallizes mostly felsic minerals

            - solidifies into rhyolite


            - glasses
                - usually associated with high silica lava

                - form from lava that is quenched to quickly for crystals to
                  form


                - Obsidian
                    - dense glass that forms from non gaseous lava

                - Pumice
                    - riddled with tiny holes (vesicles) and cavities

                    - has texture because of quencing from gaseous lava




        - Andesitic Lava
            - silica content is in between Basaltic and Rhyolitic

            - crystallizes plagioclase feldspar and amphibole

            - solidifies into andestie

            - comon along plate boundaries



        - Pyroclastic Deposits
            - wet gaseous magma erupts explosively

            - lava and surrounding rock is shattered into fragments


            - pyroclasts are the loose fragments associated with explosive
              eruptions


- Classification of Pyroclastics
    - mainly classified on basis of size

    - ash (tephra)
        < 2mm
        - minerals and glass and rock fragments

    - lapilli
        2-64 mm

    - bombs
        > 64mm
        - twisted shapes due to solidification
    - blocks
        > 64 mm
        - large chuncks of rock

    - classification of pyroclastic rocks
        - Agglomerate
            - composed of volcanic bombs

        - breccia
            - composed of volcanic blocks

        - lapilli ruff
            - cemented particles 2-64 mm

        - ash tuff
            - cemented particles < 2mm


    - vesicular Rocks


- features of volcanoes
    - opening at the summit of a volcano
        - Crater
            - summit depression < 1km in diameter

        - Caldera
            - summit depression > 1km in diameter
            - produced by collapse following a massive eruption

        - Conduit (pipe)
            - connects crater to underlying magma chamber


- Types of Volcanoes
    - Shield Volcanoes
        - Constructed from successive flows of basaltic lava

        - lavas are fluid and flow easily over great distances

        - broad gentle slopes

        - fonudn in hawaii


    - Cinder Cones
        - contrsuted from ejected lava
        - pyroclastic eruptions somtimes associated with lava flows


        - very steep slope angles
        - small size
        - frequently occur in groups


    - composite or Stratovolcanoes
        - steeper slopes

        - erupt both lava and pyroclastic material

        - common among convergent plate boundaries

        - can be found in washington / oregon (the cascades)

- Calderas
    - after a violent eruption, the magma chamber below might no longer be able
      to support the roof
        - this will colapse


    - the resulting caldera is many times the size of the original crater
        - range from a few km to more than 50 diameter


    - Crater lake oregon (7000 year ago) is a good example

    - Hawaiian type
        - formed from gradual subsidence of magma SLOWLY draining from
          underlying magma chamber


    - Yellowstone type
        - yellowstone park is a classic example


- Lava domes
    - mainly construted of rhyolitic lava

    - range from pancake like flows to steep sided plugs

    - most develop over several years following an explosive eruption


    - basically a little cone that forms in the sunken summit
        - looks like a little volcano in a volcano


- Volcanic Necks
    - relict conduits that stand higher than the surrounding landscape

    - the conduit is more resistant to erosion than the surronding cone (this
      is why it remains)

    - the resulting conduit is left standing as a neck after erosion has
      removed the cone


    - shiprock new mexico is a good example


- Volcanic Pipes
    - carry magma that original ine the mantle
        - this is the long short of these things

    - diatremes are volcanic pipes formed by gaseous explosions
        - magmas rise rapidly to surface

        - erupt gases


    - kimberlite pipes of south africa


- Plate tectonics and igneous activity
    - the global distribution of igneous activity is not random
        - most volcanoes are located within or near ocean basins

        - basaltic rocks occur in both oceanic and continental settings

        - granitic rocks are confined to continents


    - at divergent plate boundaries
        - greatest volume of volcanic rock is produced along oceanic ridge
          systems

    - convergent plate
        - magma is generated due to the release of volatiles within the
          subduction zones

        - common along the ring of fire


    - within plates
        - associated with mantle plumes

        - localized volcanic regions above the plume is called a hot spot

        - produces granitic magma in the contiental crust

        - creates flood basalts on the continent


        - fissure eruptions and flood basalts
            - associated with mantle plumes and hot spots

            - low viscosity basaltic lava erupts through fractures in crust
              called fissures

            - extensive flows are called flood basalts
                - the lava flows over great distances

                - successive flows can build up to great thicknesses
