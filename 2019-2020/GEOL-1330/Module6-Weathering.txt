- Earth's External Processes
    - weathering
        - physical breakdown and chemical alteration of rock

    - erosion
        - physical removal of material by mobile agents such as water, wind,
          etc

    - mass wasting
        - transfer of rock and soil downslope under the influence of gravity



- Weathering
    - general processes of how rock is broken down
        - sediments
        - clays
        - soils
        - dissolved substances

    - subtypes
        - chemical
            - reactions break down

        - mechanical
            - rocks are broken down by physical processes such as fracturing,
              freezing, breakage


    - factors affecting
        - surface area of rock
            - greater the surface area, the more the exposure to chemical
              agents

            - mechanical weathering accelerates chemical weathering

        - mineral content
            - some rocks disolve in weakly acidic materials

            - silicate minerals weather quite a bit

            - minerals on the low end of bohens temperature scale
                - most resistant to weathering because they are resistance to
                  chemicals


        - climate / temperature / moisture
            - chemical weathering is faster in warm moist
            - mechanical weathering is greater in cold dry places


    - differential weathering
        - rocks do not weather uniformly due to regional and local factors
            - results in many weird rock formations and landforms



                                weathering rate
                            slow                                        fast

    Mineral Solubility      Low                 Moderate                High
                            (quartz)            (pyroxene, feldspar)    (calcite)

    Rock Structure          Massive             Some zones of weakness  Very fractured or thinly bedded

    Rainfal                 Low                 moderate                heavy

    Temperature             Cold                                        hot

    Thickness of soil       None                Thin                    Thick

    Organic acticity        Sparse              Moderate                Abundant

    Length of Exposure      Short               Moderate                Long





    - Chemical Weathering
        - breaks down rock components and interal structures

        - the most important agent is water

        - alteratinos
            - decomposition of unstable
            - formation or retention of stable minerals
            - rounding of corners and edges


        - major processes
            - hydolysis
                - reaction of any substance with water

                silicates + water = clays +- dissolved substances

                - involves conversion of silicates to clays
                    feldspar + water = Al rich clay
                    (Fe, Mg) silicate + water = (Fe, Mg) clay


                - Acid Rain Formation
                    1. Co2 dissolves in raindrops
                    2. Carbonic acid forms in raindrops
                    3. Acidic rainwater dissolves K ions and silica feldspar
                       forming kaolinite
                    4. Dissolved silica and ions carried away to rivers and
                       soil

                - very common in soils
                    - rain water percolates through soil and reacs with
                      minerals in the soil



            - dissolution
                - aided by small amounts of acid in the water

                - slightly acidic water can dissolve soem non-silicates

                - halite dissolves completley in water
                    - the positive and negative components of water latche to
                      different chemicals in teh salt
                        - oxygen (-) latches to Na+
                        - Hydrogen (+) latches to Cl-

                    - this ripes them appart



            - oxidation
                - any reaction when electrons are lost form one elemnt

                - reactions with oxygen

                - iron dissolves in water as cations
                    4 Fe + 3O2 = 2 Fe2O3

                    - oxygen steals electons from Fe 2+, creating Fe3+

                    - then water reacts with Fe3+ and creates hematite



    - Mechanical Weathering
        - Rocks are broken apart by physical processes

        - subtypes
            - natural zones of weakness
                - rock is just naturally weak along some lines (fracrutes)
                - sometimes these small breaks that form allow water in

            - biological
                - roots and animals that dig and stuff

            - frost wedging
                - rocks that are fracturesd are invaded by water.
                - the water then thaws and freezes over and over, wedging it
                  open


            - salt crystal growth
                - sea spray of groundwater can prnetrate crevices and pore
                  spaces in rock

                - as the water evaporates, salt crystals form behind

                - growing crystals weaken the rock
                    - cracks are enlarged
                    - grains surrounding pore spaces are pushed apart


            - Thermal expansion and contraction
                - heating and cooling of the rock

                - swelling and shrinking of minerals with different expansion
                  rates exerts stress on the rocks outer shell

                - happens mostly in deserts
                    - hot days
                    - cold nights

            - sheeting
                - deeply buried granitic pluton
                    - under high confining pressure due to weight of overlying
                      rocks

                    - squeezed and compressed

                - over time, during uplift and erosion
                    - the unloading causes outer layer of granite to expand

                - once the granite reaches the surface, the outer layers break
                  away as sheets


                - so rock was buried and under high pressure and then comes up
                  and begins peeling off in sheets


        - soils
            - combination of minerals and organic matter, water and air

            - rock and mineral fragments (regolith) are produced by weathering
              of rocks

            - humus (decayed animal and plant remains) is a small but essential
              component


            - formation
                - starts with physical and chemical weathering
                    - bedrock is weathered
                - small orgamisms and plants begin to occupy loose material

                - larger plants with deeper roots follow soil horizons begin to
                  form from the top down


            - regolith
                - solid material that makes up the soil
                    - particles of parent rock
                    - clay minerals
                    - metal oxides
                    - organic matter

            - soil profile (layers in the soil)
                - solum or "true soil"
                    - top soil
                        - O horizon
                            - loose and partly decayed organic matter

                        - A horizon
                            - minearal matter mixed with humus

                    - E horison
                        - zone of eluviation and leeching

                    - Subsoil
                        - B horizon
                            - accumulation of clay transported from above

                - C horizon

                - unweathered parent rock




            - Factors controlling soil formation
                - parent material
                    - type of rock
                        - weathered to produce soil

                - time
                    - amount of time for soil formation

                - climate
                    - very little soil in dry climates (polar and desert)

                - plants and animals
                    - roots, burrowing animals

                - Topography
                    - optimal soil formation place is a flat plain

        - Classifying Soils
            - variations in soil formation over time leads to a great veriety
              of soils


            - soiul taxonomy
                - emphasis placed on physical and cemical properties of the
                  soil

                - 6 categories
                    - Andisols
                        - young soils in which the parent material is volcanic
                          ash and cinders

                    - gelisols
                        - forms over permifrost in artic

                    - Oxisols
                        - tropics and subtropics
                        - leached soil because of heavy rainfall


                    - aridisols
                        - soils that develop in dry places

                        - insufficient water to remove soluble minerals

                        - low organic content

                        - alot in deserts

                    - spodosols
                        - soils found in humid regions on sandy soil
                    - spodosols

                        - found in northern coniferous forests

                    - vertisols
                        - large amounts of clays
                        - a little bit in texas

                    - Mollisols
                        - dark soft soils
                        - under frass vegtations
                        - found in plains




        - Soil erosion
            - influencers
                - soil characteristics
                - climate
                - slope of what contains the soil
                - type of vegitation
                    - it actually holds soil in place


                - human factor
                    - a few centimeter's thickness of prime soil require 500
                      years to mature


            - In many places soil erosion is much greater than the rate of
              formation
