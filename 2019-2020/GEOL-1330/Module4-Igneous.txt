- Rocks if subjected to high enough temps will melt into magma
    - magma will eventually cool and crystalize and turn into igneous rock

    - if magma reaches the surface, it is called lava

- Magma has three components
    - liquid portion
        - called melt

    - solids
        - (if any)
        - mainly silicate minerals that are crystallized from the melt

    - volatiles
        - solfur dioxie, carbon dioxide, etc

- Rocks that form on the surface are called extrusive

- Rocks that form in the planet are called intrusive


- Factors affecting size of crystals
    - rate of magma cooling
        - slower: results in larger but fewer crystals
        - faster: many small crystals
        - very fast: No crystals, result in volcanic glass

    - Percent silicate content
        - ions move slower through viscous silica melt
        - high silica content can form glassy texture

        - if the initial crystal doesn't get any more ions to grow, it will
          stay tiny

    - Dissolved Gases
        - escaping gases can leave behind small holes

- Igneous Texture
    - describes the overal appearance of an igneous rock

    - Intrusive Igneous Rocks
        - formed at depth within crust

        - slow cooling of magma results in large crystals

        - termed "coarsely crystalline" or "phaneritic"

    - Porphyritic
        - Slowly cooling Instrusive are erupted to the surface

        - composed of two distrincy differnt crystal sizes
            - this is the main determining factor of this texture


    - Extrusive Igneous Rocks
        - Crystallize rapidly from lava erupted onto the surface

        - AKA volcanic rocks

        
    - Glassy
        - blobs of magma can be thrown into the air and then quickly cool into
          something called a

        - simply something that does not contain any minerals

        - Pyroclastics
            - tiny bits of rock thrust into the atmosphere

            - leaves small holes in the rock called "pumice"


    - Scoria
        - riddled with little holes

    - Pyroclastic Volcanic ROcks
        - form from broken pieces of rock, glass and mineral grains

        - rain down from the sky

        - accumulate on the ground as layers of loose material such as volcanic
          ash

- Classification of Igneous Rocks
    - three criteria
        - texture

        - chemical composition
            - mainly silica content

        - mineral content

    - The minerals are mostly silicates
        - two subtypes
            - felsic minerals
                - light colored

            - mafic
                - dark colored
                - rich in iron and magnesium


    - Ignesous Compositions
        - Felsic
            - highest silicate content
            - highest potassium and sodium content

            - most abundant minerals
            - quartz, potasium rich feldspar

        - intermediate
            - principle minerals are "plagioclase feldspars"

            - 52 - 65% SiO2

            - composed of
                - plagioclase feldspar
                - hornblende


        - mafic
            - pyroxene and calcuum rich feldspar

            - lower silica content (45 - 52% SiO2)

            - dark colored

            - abundant Ca-rich plagioclase felsbar

            - high in iron


        - ultramafic
            - highest melting temperature
            - most iron, magnesium and calcium


            - abundant Olivine and pyroxene


            - very dark in color
