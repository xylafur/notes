- Rocks if subjected to high enough temps will melt into magma
    - magma will eventually cool and crystalize and turn into igneous rock

    - if magma reaches the surface, it is called lava

- Magma has three components
    - liquid portion
        - called melt

    - solids
        - (if any)
        - mainly silicate minerals that are crystallized from the melt

    - volatiles
        - solfur dioxie, carbon dioxide, etc

- Rocks that form on the surface are called extrusive

- Rocks that form in the planet are called intrusive


- Factors affecting size of crystals
    - rate of magma cooling
        - slower: results in larger but fewer crystals
        - faster: many small crystals
        - very fast: No crystals, result in volcanic glass

    - Percent silicate content
        - ions move slower through viscous silica melt
        - high silica content can form glassy texture

        - if the initial crystal doesn't get any more ions to grow, it will
          stay tiny

    - Dissolved Gases
        - escaping gases can leave behind small holes

- Igneous Texture
    - describes the overal appearance of an igneous rock

    - Intrusive Igneous Rocks
        - formed at depth within crust

        - slow cooling of magma results in large crystals

        - termed "coarsely crystalline" or "phaneritic"

    - Porphyritic
        - Slowly cooling Instrusive are erupted to the surface

        - composed of two distrincy differnt crystal sizes
            - this is the main determining factor of this texture


    - Extrusive Igneous Rocks
        - Crystallize rapidly from lava erupted onto the surface

        - AKA volcanic rocks

        
    - Glassy
        - blobs of magma can be thrown into the air and then quickly cool into
          something called a

        - simply something that does not contain any minerals

        - Pyroclastics
            - tiny bits of rock thrust into the atmosphere

            - leaves small holes in the rock called "pumice"


    - Scoria
        - riddled with little holes

    - Pyroclastic Volcanic ROcks
        - form from broken pieces of rock, glass and mineral grains

        - rain down from the sky

        - accumulate on the ground as layers of loose material such as volcanic
          ash

- Classification of Igneous Rocks
    - three criteria
        - texture

        - chemical composition
            - mainly silica content

        - mineral content

    - The minerals are mostly silicates
        - two subtypes
            - felsic minerals
                - light colored

            - mafic
                - dark colored
                - rich in iron and magnesium


    - Ignesous Compositions
        - Felsic
            - highest silicate content
            - highest potassium and sodium content

            - most abundant minerals
            - quartz, potasium rich feldspar

        - intermediate
            - principle minerals are "plagioclase feldspars"

            - 52 - 65% SiO2

            - composed of
                - plagioclase feldspar
                - hornblende


        - mafic
            - pyroxene and calcuum rich feldspar

            - lower silica content (45 - 52% SiO2)

            - dark colored

            - abundant Ca-rich plagioclase felsbar

            - high in iron


        - ultramafic
            - highest melting temperature
            - most iron, magnesium and calcium


            - abundant Olivine and pyroxene


            - very dark in color

- Pyroclastic rocks
    - solid particles ejected during explosive volcanic eruption

    - classified based on the size of the fragments
        - Tuff
            - ash
            - less than 2mm

        - Volcanic Breccia
            - particles larger than 2mm

- Origin of Magma
    - heat plays a big part
        - rocks in lower crust an upper mantle are near to melting points

    - Geothermal Gradient
        - how temperature increases with depth in the earth
        - pressure is considered


    - Melthing temperatures of dry peridotite are everywhere higher than
      geothermal gradient
        - if volatiles are introduced into the peridotite, this causes rock to
          melt at lower temps
            - water is a good example

        - when the preidotite is wet, partial meitng can occur below 60km


    - When oceanic lithosphere is subducting continental crust, it is wet

    - roll of pressure
        - an increase in confinisng temperature with depth increases a rock's
          melting temperature

        - when mantle material rising to the surface experiences a decrease in
          pressure
            - it can cause melting from the depressureizatino


        - if you have a bunch of mantle rock really low thats really hot but
          not able to melt because of the pressure
            - if can rise up to a point (if the temperature stays high) where
              it can start melting


            - this happens below mid ocean ridges

    - Partial Melting
        - forms as a liquid when preexisting rock melts


        - peridotite is made up of olivine and pyroxene
            - pyroxene melts at a lower temperature than olivine

            - this will leave behind only the olivine crystals


        - Bowens Reaction Series
            - predicts which minerals will melt at increasing temperature

            - the stability range of different minerals in magma, depends on the
              temperature

            - melting order (low to high temperature)
                - quartz
                - muscovite mica
                - potassium feldspar

                - biotite mica

                - plagioclase feldspbar
                    - sodium rich melts first
                    - calcium rich melts last

                - amphibole
                - puroxene
                - olivine


        - With partial melting
            - all of the solid minearls that were unmelted will be of unmafic
              composition

            - the melt will have felsic composition
                - because it melts at lower temp


    - Formation of Basaltic Magma
        - Basaltic Magma
            - the same as mafic magma

        - originate from partial melting of peridotite
            - this means if forms below midocean ridges because of
              decompression melting
