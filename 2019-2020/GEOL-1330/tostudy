- Layers of earth
    - lithosphere
        - crust
            - oceanic crust (basalt)
            - continental crust (composition similar to granite)
        - upper mantle
            - composed of peridotite
            - sandwich of solid, partially molten, solid

    - Lower Mantle
        - Magnesium Rich Silicates (perovskite)

    - Outer Core
        - Iron

    - Inner Core
        - Nickel and Iron

- Wilson Cycle (Formation of an Ocean Basin)
    - Mantle Plume Below Continental Crust forms an Upwelling on the Surface
    - The crust starts to diverge
    - A Linear Sea is formed
    - Oceanic Crust begins to form

    - Example
        - East Africa Tripple Junction
            - Gulf of Aden, Red Sea, East African Rift System

- Ocean Basin
    - Continental Crust on both sides
    - Continental Shelf
    - Shelf break
        - very rapid descent from height of shelf to lower section
        - alot of sediment that accumulates here

    - Continental Slope
        - Gradual sinking of crust height

    - Continental Rise
        - Very level, flat piece of continental crust

    - Deep-Sea Fans
        - contitnental crust sediment that has been caried this far
    

- Subduction Zone
    - When one plate goes under another

    - Components
        - Trench
            - deep depressoin on sea floor
        - Accretionary Wedge
            - Sediment acumulates here?
        - Forarc Basin


- Convergent Plate Boundary Types
    - Ocean-Ocean
        - ocean goes under ocean

        - Aleutian Islands between Russia and Alaska

    - Ocean-Continent
        - ocean goes under continent

        - Andes of south america
    - Continent-Continent
        - continent goes under continent

        - india / asia

- Convergent Plate Boundary
    - represented as a saw tooth line with the triangles pointing in the
      direction of the subducting plate


- Collage Tectonics
    - WHere a bunch of micro contienents dog pile together because a subducting
      oceanic plate is pushing the micro contrineent into the existing
      continent


- Mineral
    - Naturally Occurring
    - Solid within temperature ranges
    - Orderly crystiline structure
    - inorganic
    - well defined chemical composition


- Types of Bonds
    - Ionic
        - one element gains an electron, the other loses one

    - Covalent
        - Electron shells overlap

    - Metallic
        - electrons pack together
        - electrons are mobile and move around freely



- Polymorphs
    - Two minerals that have the same chemical composition but differ in
      crystal structure
    - the atoms are just arranged differently


- Mineral Classes
    - Silicates
        - most common!  Huge majority of minerals on earth

        - composed of silicon ions surrounded by 4 oxygen
            - Silicate (silicon-oxygen) tetrahedron

        - Classes
            - Oxygens do not bind together, tetrahedra are seperate
                - Olivine
                    - primary metal in mantle peridotite
            - Pyroxene Group
                - single chain of tetrahedra
                - each tetrahedra only has 3 oxyens

            - Amphioble Group
                - Double chain

            - Sheets
                - The silicate tetrahedra form into sheets

            - 3D networks
                - Quartz is a prime example
                - Every tetrahedra shares all of its oxygen


    - Carbonites
        - all comprised of the corbonite unit

        - will fizz when interacted with hydrochloric acid

    - Sulfates
        - sulfar is present as the sulfate ion

        - Anhydrite and Gypsum

    - Halides
        - The anion comes from the second to last column of the periodic table

        - Halite, Sylvite, FLourite

    - Native Element Minerals
        - All just one element: gold, diamond, graphite, etc...


- Physical Characteristics
    - Color
    - Streak
    - Hardness
        - You use the Mohs Scale to identify

    - Tenacity
        - resistance to cracking / breaking

    - cleavage
        - tendency of a crystal to break along flat planar surfaces

        - Can cleave in pretty much any direction,
            - 2 angles at 90 degress, 2 angles not at 90 degrees, 3 directions
              at or not at 90 degrees, d4 shape


        - Cleavage planes are always flat!

        - Cleavage planes do not always coincide with crystal faces


    - Fracture
        - tendency to break along irrectular surfaces

    - Luster
        - how it reflects light
        - types
            - Metalic
            - Vitreous
                - reflects like glass
            - Dull
            - Greasy
            Adamantine
                - luster of a diamond
