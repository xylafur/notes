- The stratiagraphic record
    - the layering of sedimentary rocks is called sedimentation

    - layered rocks reflect original deposition

    - these are often pushed far away from eachother across continents or something

    - different parts of each could have been eroded awayo

    - correltation
        - matching rock layers from one exposure with its counterpart at a different location

        - we have two layers of rocks seperated by distance, we can look at the layers on the two
          different exposures to see if they match up


    - Correlation and geology maps
        - correlation determines original grographic extent


- Fossils
    - evidence of past life
    - traces or remains of ancient rocks

    - only preserved under favorable conditions
        - the thing must have had hard parts
            - there is a bias in the fossil record for organisms with very hard parts

            - not alot of evidence of plants and worms

        - rapid burial
            - the organism shouldn't decay

        - rarely soft parts can be preserved in oxygen poor enviornments


    - Mold
        - eepresision in rock that assumes shape of original fossil

    - Casts
        - if a mold is filled with some secondary material this can form into the shape of the mold

    - Permineralizatoin
        - occurs in woody material

        - groundwater penetrates into wood and dissolves silica in groundwater
        - the groundwater crystalizes in the pore space

    - carbonization
        - gas and liquid components of decaying orfanism in sediment is squeezed out by pressure
        - this leaves behind a carbon film


    - Trace fossils
        - markins or objects left behind by ancient life

        - tracks, burrows, excrement



    - Fossils and correlation
        - fossils succeed one another over time
        - any given period can be recognized by its fossil content


    - Fossil Ranges
        - a range is a time interval over which a particular species or group of species lived

- Stratiagraphy
    - sub science of geology that attempts to organize the rock record into a manageable
      classification scheme

    - formation
        - basic loacal unit of stratography

        - a particular rock unit is grounped into a formation based on distinctive appearance


        - Lithostratigraphy (formations)
            - distringuished by
                - mineral composition
                - texteral properties
                - color
                - thickness
                - organic remains
                - outcroup character


- Unconformities
    - represent old erosional surfaces or intervals of missing strata within the rock sequence

    - 3 types
        - angular unconformity
            - old erosional surface sepearating tiolted or folded sedimentary rocks below from flat
              lying sedimentary rocks above

        - nonconformity
            - old erosional surface seperating younger sedimentary rocks above from older igneous
              and metamorphic rocks below

            - sequence of formation
                - metamorphic rock over some intrusive igneous rock
                - the metamorphic rock is eroded away exposing the igneous
                - sediment eventually builds up on top

        - disconformity
            - old erosional sufrance rock where layered sedimentary rocks above and below are both
              parallel

            - how do they form?
                - deposition of horizontal layers
                - weathering erodes surface
                - eroded surface covered by later sediment

- principles of relative dating
    - to relatively date, we take into consideration different things
        - law of superposition
            - in an undeformed sequence of sedimentary rocks, each bed is older than the one above,
              and younder than the one below


        - Principle or ofiginal horisintally
            - sediments are initially depositied in horizontal layers

            - resulting sedimentary rocks should also be horizaontally layerd
            - thus any warped or deformation in layer of sedimentary rocks, this has to have
              happened after original deposition


        - principle of lateral continuity
            - sedimentary rocks originanate as continous layers that extend in all directions
            - eventually thinning out at the edge of a basin


        - principle of cross curring relationships
            - if a fault cuts rock or a magma intrudes rock
                - that fault / magma are yonger than the rocks they intruded
                - faulting and intrusion occured after the sediments were deposited and lithified



- inclusions
    - fragments of a rock unit enclosed in another rock unit

    - the rock nit that suplied the inclusions must be older than the rock containing the
      inclusions

- Radiometric Dating
    - gives absolute age of geologig mineral
    - uses radioactive isotopes of elements


    - types of radioactive decay
        - alpha
            - loss of 2 protons and 2 neutrons
                - these 4 together are called an alpha particle

            - the resulting isotope has an atomic number of 2 less
                - the atomic mass is 4 less

        - beta
            - a neutron is changed into an electron
            - atomic number increases by one
            - no change in atomic mass
            - the neutron gives off an eletron and that makes it turn into a proton?

        - electron capture
            - changes a proton into a neutron
            - atomic # decreases by one
            - no change in atomic mass


    - requirements for radiometric dating
        - need to know halflife
        - need to know parent daughter ratio in a sample
            - this is measured with a mass spectrometer
            - you liquify then ionize some of the rock and shoot it thgough a magnetic field
            - this will split up the different elements by different amounts



    - resettting isotopic ages
        - metamorphism and increase in demp can cause the daugther elements to escape the mineral
        - this will reset the rock back to only unstablel elmenet parent element

        - this means you can check either whole rock age, or just mineral ages
            - mineral ages determine age of last metamorphic event


    - Carbon 14 dating
        - cosmic rays in atmosphere shatter gas atoms
            - this releases neutrons

        - some of the neutrons are absorbed by nitrogen

        - nitrogen kicks out a proton and converts into Carbon-14
        - living matter absorbs Ni / Co2
            - some of this will be Carbon 14

        - has a halflife of 5730 years

        - during life the ratio of carbon-14 in living things is constant since it is always
          replaced


    - Dating in sedimentary rocks doesn't really work, sedimentary rocks are made up or many
      different rocks.
        - multiple parent rocks of different ages can create teh sedimentary rocks


        - though isotopic dating of sedimentary rocks is possible if it contains authigenic
          minerals or material (glauconite, K-feldspar or organic matter)
