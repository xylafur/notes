- Matter and Minerals (Video 1)
    - What is a mineral?
        - has to be naturally occuring
        - solid within temperature
        - form orderly crystaline structure
        - well defined chemical composition
        - generally inorganic (even though they may contain carbon)

    - Atom
        - smallest unit of an element that retains the physical and chemical
          properties of that element

        - electrically neutral
            - # electrons == # protons


        - atomic #
            - number of protons

        - Atomic Mass
            - sum of the masses of all protons and neutrons

        - ordered in increasing atomic order in the periodic table


        - electron shells
            - electrons occur in an "electron cloud" or "electron shells"
                - different shells have different energy levels
                - valence electrons are those that occur in the outer most
                  shell

            - The shells can hold this many electrons
                - the periodic table is set out in the way it does because the
                  first column has 1 electron in the outer most shell, and the
                  rith most is full for the outer most shell
                    - the number of columns in a given row shows you the max
                      number of electrons in the outer most shell

                1. 2
                2. 8
                3. 8
                4. It starts getting complicated


            - dot diagrams
                - the number of dots around the element symbol is the number of
                  valence electrons in the outer most shell

            - isotopes
                - have the same number of protons, but different in the number
                  of neutrons

            - ions
                - when an atom loses, or gains a proton or an electron and is
                  no longer electrically neutral


                - when an atom is positively charged, it is called a cation
                    - some elements can lose more than just 1 electron, such as
                      magnesium
                        - it can lose two


                - when an element gains an electron and is negatively charged,
                  it is called an anion
                    - chlorine and bromine can become anions

                    - oxygen can aquire 2 more electrons
                        - it has 6 in its outer shell

        - Chemical Reactions and bonds
            - elements can combine with other elements to form compounds


            - in chemical reactions, only the valence electrons in the
              outermost shells interact
                - elements form chemical bonds in order to fill their outer
                  most shells with electrons
                    - types of bonds
                        - ionic bonds
                            - one element loses an electron, another aquires an
                              electron

                            - an example is sodum kicking out its extra
                              electron and chlorine aquiring its electron
                                - these guys form an ionic bond and create
                                  table salt

                        - covalent bonds
                            - the electron shells of elements overlap with
                              adjacent elements

                            - electrons are shared

                            - carbon does this alot.
                                - carbon atoms share two electrons with
                                  adjacent carbon atoms

                        - metallic bonds
                            - electrons pack together as cations
                            - the electrons are mobile and move around freely


    - Minerals
        - A mineral constitutes an orderly arrangment of atoms
        - minerals can have different orderly arangment (crystal structures)

        - in a diamond, each carbon atom shares electrons with four adjacent
          atoms

            - the arangment of carbon is graphite is much different, so it
              makes it much different than diamonds
            - the bonds are much weaker, which makes it a very weak mineral


        - Halite (sodium chloride) (table salt)
            - each soduim atom is bonded to six chlorine atoms, and each
              chlorine atom is bonded to six sodium atoms

            - this arrangment results in the atomic structure of a cube
                - the angles are 90 degree


        - Calcite (CaCO3)
            - three oxygens bond to a carbon atom
            - A calcium ion is at the corners, connecting laters of cubes


        - Atoms occur in different sizes, which can affect the type of crystal
          structure formed when they bond together


        - Crystals of minerals
            - different minerals have different crystal forms due to
              differences in the internal arrangment of atoms

            - we cannot see the atomic arrangment of a mineral directly, but we
              can see the overall shape


        - Crystal faces and angles
            - quartz
                - flat surfaces are called crystal faces

                - the intersection of crystal faces are always intersecting at
                  angles of about 120 degrees


        - Polymorphs
            - Two minerals that have the same chemical composition but differ
              in crystal structure



            - Examples
                - graphite / diamond
                - calcite / aragonite
                - (low temp) quartz / (high temp) cristobalite


- Minerals continued (video 2)
    - Mineral Classes
        - Silicates
            - largest category of minerals
            - minerals comprised of silicon ions and surrounded by four oxygen
              ions
                - represented by formula: (SiO4)^4-

            - There are many different cations

            - the basic building block is the Silicon - Oxygen TEtrahedron
                - ther is a lone silicon atom in the middle surrounded by
                  oxygen atoms

                - looks like a triiangular pyramid with oxygen at the corners
                  and silicon in the middle

            - Silicate Structures
                - There is a single type where the oxygens do not bind together
                    - the tetrahedrons to not intersect, they are all isolated

                - this minerals in this group are called Olivine

                - the cations are magnesium and iron
                    - this are the ones that link the individual tetrahedrons

                - Olivine is the primary metal in mantle peridotite!

                - the tetrahedons can bind in a weird way where they make a
                  bunch of funky structures




            - Single and Double Chains of Tetrahedra (different groups of
              minerals that are different because of the way these silicate
              trtrahedra bind together)
                - Pyroxene Group
                    - single chain of tetrahedra
                    - there are only 3 oxygens because they bond with a
                      negiiboring tetrahedra to form a chain

                - Amphibole group
                    - Double Chain

                    - each of the tetrahedra only have 2 oxygens, so they bond
                      in a hexagonal formation


            - Sheets
                - tetrahedra can also combine to form sheets

                - These are called Micas
                    - two subcategories
                        1. Biotite
                        2. Muscovite

                - You can peel these apart as sheets of mineral


            - 3D Networks of Tetrahedra
                - each tetrahedra is sharing all 4 of its oxygen atoms


                - Good examples of this class of silicate tetrahedra
                    - Feldspars
                        - Potassium Feldspar
                            - rich in potasium
                            - pinkish
                        - Plagioclase
                            - rich in calcium
                            - more white color

                    - Quartz
                        - do not have any cleavage!
                            - because of the way they bind, there is no weak direction


            - Silicates are the most common minerals in earths crust!

        - Non silicates are simply minerals without silicon
            - really easy to determine if something is a silicate or not based
              on the formula (is silicon a part of it?)


        - Carbonites
            - non silicate

            - are all comprised of the carbonite unit (CO3)^2-

            - many different carbonate minerals, depending on which cation is
              attached to the carbonate complex


            - You can identify calcite by dropping weak hydrochloric acid on it
                - it will fizz


        - Oxides
            - Minerals where a cation is bounded to oxygen

            - two important types
                - Hematite
                    Fe2O3
                - Megnetite
                    Fe3O4

                - these bond differently because of the oxydation state of iron


        - Sulfates
            - Sulfur is present as the sulfate ion

            - Two important sulfates
                - Anhydrite
                    CaSO4

                - Gypsum
                    CaSO4 * 2*H20)


        - Sulfides
            - non silicates where cations are bonded to sullfur ion

            - two important types
                - pyrite
                    FeS2

                - galena
                    PbS


            - Cubic Crystals


        - Halides
            - Anion is in the second to last column of periodic table

            - generally form ionic bonds

            - Imporant types
                - Halite (table salt)
                - Sylvite
                - Flourite

        - Native Element Minerals
            - composed of only one element

            - Examples
                - Graphite (C), Diamond (C), Copper (Cu), Gold, Sulfur


    - The Physical Properties of Minerals
        - unique physical and chemical characteristics to identify minerals


        - Physical Properites
            - Color:
                - color can sometimes be used to identify a mineral
                - color is not usefult in all cases

            - Streak
                - the color left behind when scratching a mineral on a tile of
                  unglazed porcelain


                - most silicates leave behind a colorless streak

            - Hardness
                - the ease by which the surface of a mineral can be scratched

                - we use the Mohs (moes) scale.
                    - Ranges from Talc (softest, 1) to Diamond (Hardest, 10)

                - Minerals below 5.5 will not scratch glass

            - Tenacity
                - toughness ro resistance to cracking / breaking

                - many different tenacity things
                    - Brittleness
                    - Malleability
                    - Flexibility

            - Cleavage
                - the tendency of a crystal to break along flat planar surfaces

                - covalent bonds are generally strong and have poor cleavage
                - ionic bonds are relatively weak and yield good cleavage

                - cleavage directions
                    - cleavage in one direction
                        - you can peel it apart, Muscovite is an example
                        - Micas
                            - peels off in layers
                            - there are weak bonds in between the sheets of
                              tetrahedra

                    - Cleavage in 2 angles at 90 degress
                    - Cleavage in two directions not at 90 degrees
                    - Cleavage in 3 directions bo
                    - basically cleavage in every possible way
                        - cleavage in 4 directions! Like a d4 shape

                - cleavage planes are always flat!!!

                - cleavage planes do not always coincide with the crystal faces

            - Fracture
                - tendency of a mineral to break along irregular surfaces

            - Specific Gravity
                - heavier minerals have higher specific gravity

                - measure of the mass of a mineral, divided by the mass of an
                  equal volume of water

                - So has to do with how dense it is?


            - Luster
                - the way a mineral reflects light

                - types
                    - metallic
                        - strong reflection but opaque
                    - Vitreous
                        - reflects like glass
                    - Dull
                    - Greasy
                        - looks like its coated in oil

                    - Adamantine
                        - brilliant luster of diamond



            - Form or Habit
                - the shape in which the crystal grows

            - Magnetism

            - Feel
                - feels greasy or something

            - Taste


    - Cleavage Plane
        - where the rock wants to break at

        - if you tried to break it, where it would probably break from

        - the cleavage angle can be used to identify different minerals
