- Geology: The science that pursues an understanding of planet Earth
    - Physical Geology: Examines the materials composing the earth

    - Problems and issues addressed by geology
        - natural hazards (earth quakes, mudslides, volcanos, etc..)
        - minearl resources (gas, copper, etc)
        - world population growth
            - Need to know where mineral resources are so we can use them

        - Enviornmental Issues
            - how will drilling for this oil effect the enviornment?
            - storing Nuclear waste

    - THe nature of scientific Inquiry
        - sience (and therefore geology) assumes that the natural world is consistent and predicable

        - goal of science is to discover patterns in nature

        - difference between hypothesis and theory
            - hypothesis: Untested explanation
                - must be testable to see if this is the best explanation
                - must be able to be proven false

                - to test you keep collecting data and see if this data is
                  consistent or inconsistent with the assumption

            - theory: well-tested and widely accepted view that scientist agree
                      supports vertain observational facts
                - Must also be testable and falsifiable


    - Earth as a System
        - the goal of earth system science is to study earth as a system
          composed of numerous interacting parts of subsystems

        - interdisiplenary

        - two major sources of energy
            - sun: external heat enginer
            - earth's internal heat engine

    - What is a system
        - any size group of interacting parts that form a complex whole

        - most natural systems driven by sources of energy that move matter and
          or energy from one place to another

        - open system
            - energy and matter flow into and out of system

        - closed system
            - energy moves freely in and out
            - matter does not enter or leave the system

- Basic Rock Types
    - Igneous Rocks
        - formed from cooling and solidification

    - Sedimentary Rocks
        - derived from weathering of preexisting rock

    - Metamorphic Rocks
        - formed by changing preexisting igneous sedimentary or other
          metamorphic rocks


- The ROck Cycle
    - generation of Magma from prexisting ROck
        - rocks are melted at very high temperatures into rocks
        - this produces igneous rock

    - weathering of rocks into sediment
        - this is picked up by wind, wsater or other agents and eventually
          turns into sedimentary rock


- Our Solar System
    - Terrestrial Planets
        - 4 inner plannets
        - all small rocky bodies, densities greater than 3gm / cm^3
        - composed mosply of silicates, Iron and Nickel

        - Volcanism mostly basaltic


    - Jovian Planets
        - 4 outer planets

        - all have a solid rocky core, surrounded by layers of frozen or liquid
          hydrogen, helium, methane and ammonia

    - Nebular Hypothesis
        - Assumes that the solar system began as a giant rotating cloud of gas
          and dust called the solar nebula

        - rotating nebula began to contract about 5 billion years ago
            - developed into a flat, disk shape with the proto sun at the
              center



        - Composition of the SOlar Nebula
            - mainly hydrogen and helium

            - also some particles of rocks and iron, methane and other gases

        - This nebula began to slowly contract and condense because of gravity
            - the nebula turns into a rotating disk

        - the nebla cools and then condenses into tiny solid particles

        - the particles then coalesce into asteroid-size bodies
            - these smaller bodies collided with one another and eventually
              formed large bodies (planets)

        - the rotational motion (and I guess the flatness) of our solar system
          is because of how the nebular originally collapsed into a disk

    - Formation of the moon
        - we were hit by a mars sized object about 4.5 billion years ago

        - this send a portion of the planet spiraling around and eventually all
          of the debris coalesced into the moon


- Earth
    - Crust
        - can be divided into oceanic and continental

        - oceanic
            - ranges 0 - 10 km thick
            - average composition of basalt

        - continental
            - 33 - 70 km thick
            - average composition close to granite

    - Lithosphere includes crust and solid uper portion of the mantle
        - upper manttle is composed mosly of peridotite


        - below this solid region of peridotite there is a section of the
          mantle known as the "weak layer" which is comprised of partially
          molten peridotite

        - then below this layer there is a layer of solid peridotite again



    - Lower mantle
        - Below the lithosphere
        - solid down to a depth of 2900 km

        - composed of high density Mg-silicate rock known as perovskite

    - Outer Core
        - Extends from 2900 km to 5100 km depth

        - mainly molten iron

    - Inner Core
        - Extends from 5,100 km depth to the center of earth

        - mostly Iron and Nickel

- Geologic Time
    - geologist assign accurate dates to events in Earth's history

    - relative dating
        - geologic events and materials are placed in their proper sequence or
          order of occurance without knowing their ages

    - absolute dating
        - uses isotopes to assign actual ages to rocks and events


    - Geologists measure time using the geological time scale

        - divided into eons, era, periods and epochs
