Problem 5:
    A sample of hydrogen gas has a temperature of 500°C . Calculate the average mo-
    lecular speed in m/s. Express this also in ft/s. Note: Gaseous hydrogen exists as the
    molecule H 2 with a mass of 3.3 * 10 -27 kg .

Problem 7:
    An RTD has alpha(20°C) = 0.004/°C . If R = 106 (ohm) at 20°C , find the resistance at 25°C .

problem 10:
    Suppose the RTD of Problem 7 has a dissipation constant of 25 mW /°C and is
    used in a circuit that puts 8 mA through the sensor. If the RTD is placed in a bath at
    100°C , what resistance will the RTD have? What then is the indicated temperature?

Problem 11:
    In Problem 8, the RTD is replaced by a thermistor with R(20°C) = 100 ⍀ and an
    R versus T of -10%/°C near 20°C . Calculate the voltage resolution of the detector
    needed to resolve a 1.0°C change in temperature.

Problem 15
    A type S thermocouple with a 21°C reference measures 12.120 mV. What is the junc-
    tion temperature?

Problem 17
    A type K thermocouple with a 0°C reference will monitor an oven temperature at
    about 300°C .
        a. What voltage would be expected?
        b. Extension wires of 1000-ft length and 0.01 ⍀兾ft will be used to connect to the
           measurement site. Determine the minimum voltage measurement input
           impedance if the error is to be within 0.2%.

Problem 18
    We need to get 1.5 V from a candle flame at about 700°C . How many type K ther-
    mocouples will be required in series if the reference is assumed to be nominal room
    temperature, 70°F ?

Problem 20
    A gas thermometer has a pressure of 125 kPa at 0°C and 215 kPa at some unknown
    temperature. Determine the temperature in °C .

Problem 21
    A methyl chloride vapor-pressure thermometer will be used between 70°F and
    200°F . What pressure range corresponds to this temperature range?
