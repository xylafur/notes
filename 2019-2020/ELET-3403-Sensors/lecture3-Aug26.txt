- Evaluation Critera of a Control System
    - Stability
    - Static Performance
        - when it goes through transitions (after something changes and the
          system responds)

        - In the steady state, do we reach the desired value or only aproximate
          it?
            - how close do we get to the desired value

    - Dynamic Performance
        - Do we get to the desired value withing a particular timeframe


- Terms
    - Hysteresis
        - can have one input value and two output values
