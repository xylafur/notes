- Case statement
    - choose which or two more diagrams to execute based on the input

    - there is a box at the top that you choose each possible input and then
      change the block diagram inside based on which one is selected


    - there is a default case



- Event Structreus
    - Can use this to implement event driven programing
        - code waits for an event, and then the event handler is triggered


    - you can have an event handler triggered whenever the user does something
      on the front panel


    - you use an event structure, and you choose which events it should handle


    - its like a case statement in the way that you select the event that
      triggers it at the top and then the block contains what should execute in
      that case


    - two different types of events
        - polling
            - polling structures can poll the front pannel to check for changes
            - slower to responsd and can fail to detect changes
            - cpu intensive

        - event
            - no events are missed
            - guarantees reponse
