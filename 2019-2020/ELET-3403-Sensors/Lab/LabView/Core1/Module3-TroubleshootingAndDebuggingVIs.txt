- if the run button is broken then there are errors in the VI
    - Broken or unwired components are the common causeos


    - There is an error list that displays all errors
        - There is a show error button in the error list that will show you
          where the error is in the block diagram


- Debugging
    - you can control the pace of execution as well has have the program
      execute one step at a time

    - probe tool
        - you can check the values on a wire as a VI runs

    - breakpoints
        - you can pause execution at a point on a wire


    - retain wire values
        - have wires hold their previous values

- Error Handling
    - lab view will by default pause execution, and have a pop up that is
      displayed to the user
        - this is called automatic error handling

    - you can add manual error handling
        - you connect error wires to the manual error handling square
        - an error is passed along an error wire until it gets to an error
          handling VI

    - you can disable automatic error handdling for all VIs by default in the
      block diagram options

    - Error Clusters
        - Errors either happen as errpr codes or error clusters
            - error clusters have error inputs and error outputs


        - there is an "explain error" dialog box that you can open


    - Merge errors
        - can merge errors from different wires and propogate them forwared.
        - if there was no error, then the merge error will propogate the first
          warning

        - comprised of status, code and source
