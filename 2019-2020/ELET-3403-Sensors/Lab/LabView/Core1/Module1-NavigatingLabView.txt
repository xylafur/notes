- lab view is a graphical programming enviornment that aids in combining
  hardware and software
    - it is a super IDE to allow for creation of systems


- Lab view programs are called virtual instruments (VI)
    - they emulate physical instruments

    - every VI has a front pannel (gui that displays output) and a block
      diagram back end

- Folder types
    - auto populated folder
        - creates a folder within the project and on disk

    - virtual folder
        - creates a folder only within the project, not an actual folder on
          disk

- Components of a block diagram
    - Front pannels can have controls and indicators
        - on the block diagram we will see those reflected as terminals
        - terminals are the IO ports in the block diagram


    - Nodes are objects on the block diagram that have inputs and outputs and
      perform operations
        - have pale yellow icons

    - sub vis
        - vis that run within another vi
        - any vi can be used as a sub vi

        - if you double click on the sub vi then you can view its front pannel
          and block diagram

        - express vi
            - type of sub vi configured with dialoge boxes

    - wires transfer data between block diagram elements
        - cannot run a vi with a broken wire

        - different wire colors represent different wire types
