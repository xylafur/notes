- Two types of loops
    - while loops
        - says its similar to a do-while loops

        - to create
            - select the loop from the palet
            - select the components that you wish to loop over
            - then a 'while loop boundary encloses this section'
            - a while loop always executes at least once

            - you choose the boolean value that is checked in the while loop, it is
              in the bottom right corner of the loop construct

            - there are tunnels that lead into and out of the while loop
                - apear as a solid block on the side of the loop box


    - for loops
        - to create
            - select the loop from the palet
            - select the components that you wish to loop over

            - the top left corner is the number of times we should loop


            - bottom left is the current loop count

            - there is a shift register that holds the value between iterations

- tunnels
    - transfer data into and out of loops

    - when a loop terminates, it leaves out of the output tunnel


- timing
    - you can use a wait function inside of a loop

    - elapsed time vi can keep track of how much time has passed


- shift register
    - basically a temp variable that can be used within a loop construct

    - shift registers can be given an initial value, this time each time the
      construct starts the shift register takes that value


    - loops can have more than one shift registers
        - shift register input / output need to be directly across from
          eachother


    - stacked shift registers
        - acts like a queue, but you can access more than just the last element


- Plotting Data
    - you can use the waveform chart to plit data

    - select the chart properties by right clicking and chosing properties

    - you can configure how the chart updates
