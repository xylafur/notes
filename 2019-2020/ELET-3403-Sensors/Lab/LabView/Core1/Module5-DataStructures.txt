- Arrays
    - can only group data of same type

    - can be built with "almost" any data type

    - can have multidimensional arrays
        - first index is row, second is column

        - does not allow arrays of arrays


    - using arrays
        - creating
            - Place an "array shell"
            - put something like numeric control inside of the array shell
            - you then manually resize the array by dragging it

            - there is an "index display" on the left of the array, this
              changes what the left most element of the array is

        - uninitialized arrays
            - the elements are greyed out


        - array function
            - within the array palet, there are a bunch of functions that you
              can do on arrays

            - there are things like
                {"size": give size
                 "subarray": create sub array from index and size,
                 "build array": concatenate two arrays can use to concatentae
                                or create 2d arrays,
                 "index array": returns value at an index,
                 ...
                 ...
                }


    - polymorphism
        - some functions accept more than just one data type
        - they will accept both an integer as well as an integer array

    - with loops
        - you can use basically enhanced for loop by plugging in an auto
          incrementing input tunnel

- Clusters
    - good for data of mixed types

    - like a record or a struct

    - on the front pannel you can create a cluster box and just drag elements
      into it

    - clusters are ordered, the order is how they show up in the cluster
      display

    - you can make a type def and then use that particlar type def in other VIs
