- Local and Global Variables
    - genrally wires are used to direct data

    - When wires won't work, we can use variables


    - Variables are block diagram elements that you can use from different
      parts of the block diagram


    - local variables
        - limited to within a VI
        - to create within a block diagram
            - right clock, create, variable

    - global variables
        - can access and pass data between several VIs
        - Can be one or more data types

- Using Variables Appropriately
    - Allow you to circumvent normal data flow
        - they are useful in parallel architectures, but can cause race
          conditions

    - Drawback
        - cannot use a boolean control with a latch mechanical action
            - has to be switch


        - Only transfer the most recent data!
            - kind of like signals for VHDL

        - If you need to transmit a bunch of data, variables are not what you
          want
            - you will only get some of the data if data is written faster than
              the data is read

            - you also can recieve duplicate data if you read faster than you
              write


- Avoiding Race Conditions
    - when you don't specify, tasks can be scheduled in any order

    - the module suggests
        - minimizing the number of writers to a variable

        - specify the execution order with wires or sequences


        - use subvis, connector panes and wires to transfer data whenever
          possible
