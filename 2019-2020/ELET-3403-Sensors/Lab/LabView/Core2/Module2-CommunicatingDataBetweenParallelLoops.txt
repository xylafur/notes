- Parallel Loops
    - when you need to execute tasks simultaniously or at different rates

    - Local variables aren't good for when you want to transfer every piece of
      data from a loops
        - either missed data or duplicates


        - local variables are only good when you need to transfer the latest
          data

- Queues
    - Can be used to transfer every piece of data between parallel loops

    - use stuff from the "Queue Operations" section to use queue stuff

    - you can transfer stuff between two VIs with a queue

    - obtain queue function
        - creates the queue before loops begin
        - constructor or somethin i guess

    - enqueue element
        - add data to the queue

    - dequeue element
        - get the latest (or oldest I guess) from the queue

    - get queue status
        - returns things like "How many elements are in the queue"

- Notifiers
    - can pass data between parallel loops

    - can broadcast the latest data to multiple loops that are waiting on a
      notification

    - Do not buffer data

    - they do broadcast data (and queues to not)


    - only get the latest notification
        - so if the loop is running and then two new notificatinos come in, it
          will only process the most recent one when it finishes
