V_750_C = 42.281 # mV


At room temp we are reading a value of 0.1722
If we divide this by 200 we get 0.000861
This is 16 degree C on the J type thermocouple chart

We are seeing the voltage measured at the output of the op amp decrease when we
couch the thermo couple 


at room temperature we see it peak around .2 V
WHen I grab it with my fingers I see it drop to 1.6 but not consistently
