2. Displacement, Location or Position Sensors
    2.1 Potentiometric Sensors
        - Converts linear or angular motion into a changing resistance
            - A potentiometric displacement sencor is pretty simple.
                - just a wound resistor and a wiper.  Moving the wiper causes motion against the
                  resistor, leading to a different output resistance

            [ figure 5.1 ]

    2.2 Capcaitive and Inductive Sensors
        - displacement causes changes in capacity or inductance

        - Capactitive
            - using the capitance equation, we can figure out how the sensor works
                - C = K * Eo * A / d

            - Three cays to change capacity
                - Distance between plates
                - Shared Area of Plates
                - Dielectric Constant

        - Inductance
            - a core is inserted into an inductor
                - this produces a new inductance value
            - as the core moves through the inductor, the inductance value changes




    2.3 Variable-Reluctance Sensors
        - Moving a core produces a varying magnetic flux coupling between two or more coils

        - applications to measure both translational and angular displacement

        - Linear Variable Differential Transformer (LVDT)

            [ figure 5.2 ]

            - most common Variable Reluctance Sensors
            - 3 coils of wire wound on a hollow form

            - core of a permiable material can slide freely through the center of the form
                - the inner coil is the primary
                    - it is excied by some AC source
                    - flux is formed and linked to two secondary coils

                - an ac voltage is then induced in the two secondary coils

                [ figure 5.3 ]

                - you can determine the direction of motion by the ac in the secondary coils
                    - voltage amplitude and phase change can determine the direction and extent of
                      core motion

                [ figure 5.4 ]

    2.4 Level Sensors
        - There are a variety of techniques

        - Mechanical
            - a floater allowed to ride up and down with level changes

            [ figure 5.5 ]

        - electrical
            - You can use the inheret conductivity of a liquid or solid to vary resistance through
              probles in the material

            - You can also use two cylendars
                - the cylinders act as capacitors, the dielectric constant changes depending on the
                  level of liquid / air over different components

                [ figure 5.6 ]


        - Untrasonic
            - you don't have to actually place anything in the material, you use ultrasonic
              reflection to measure

            [ figure 5.7 ]

        - Pressure
            - non contact measurement based on density of liquid

            - you can use the desnity of liquid and pressure at bottom of the tank to determine the
              height


3 Strain Sensors
    - usually used as a secondary step in sensors to measure other process variables, such as:
        - flow
        - pressure
        - weight
        - acceleration

    3.1 Stress and Stran
        - Forces
            - defined in a special way described by the general term stress

        - Strain
            - resulting deformation in a solid from stress
            - the result of the application of forces to solid objects

        - Stress
            - Force per unit of area

            - tensile Stress/Strain
                - F / A

                [ figure 5.8 ]

                - strain for tensile stress is defined as the fractional change in length
                    delta(l) / l

                    - unitless

            - compressional Stress/Strain
                - The only difference between this and tenisile stress/strain is the polarity of
                  the change in length

            - Shear Stress/Strain
                - the force is applied as a couple (not along the same line)

                [ figure 5.9 (a) ]

                - strain is thus
                    - fractional change in dimension of the sheared member

                    [ figure 5.9 (b) ]


            - Stress-Strain Curve
                - relationship between sress and strain is linear over some range of stress
                    - if the stress is kept within this range, the material is called "elastic"

                - If the elastic limit is exceeded, permenent deformation of the material occurs

                - linearity and slope are a constant of the type of material only

                - the constant of linearity / slope is called the "modulus of elasticity" or
                  "Young's Modulus"
                    - the unit is N/m^2

                - For tensile and compressional stress
                    E = stress / strain = (F/A) / (delta(l) / l)

                - For Shear stress
                    M = stress / strain = (F/A) / (delta(x) / l)

            - Strain Nits
                - though strain is unitless, it is common to express strain as the ratio of two
                  length units (cm/cm or in/in)

                

    3.2 Strain Gauge Principles
        - Reminder: Resistance of a metal is given by
            Ro = p * (lo / Ao)

        - Under tensile or compressional stress, the length / area of a metal will change
            - the volume must remain the same though

                V = lo * Ao = (lo + delta(l) * (Ao - delta(A))

            - Because of thie, the resistance will have changed
                R = p * (lo + delta(l)) / (Ao - delta(A)) ~= 2 * Ro * delta(l) / lo

            - we see that the ratio of change in length over length can be directly converted into
              a resistance

            - The change in resistance is very small though, so the measurement methods must be
              highly sophisticated

        - Measurement Principles
            - attach a metal wire or foil to the element whose strain is to be measured


        - Temperature Effects
            - change temperature can really fuck shit up, a change of 1 degree C can alter the
              resistance of the metal we are trying to measure strain for by alot more than the
              change in length does

    3.3 Metal Strain Guages
        - important terms for understanding strain guage applications

        - Gague factor
            - relation between strain and resistance change is only approximately true
                - impurities in the metal or other lurking factors can muck stuff up

            - an SG giceves relationship through the "gague factor"
                GF = (delta(R) / R) / strain

                - the higher the GF the better
                    - larger change in resistance for a given strain

        - Construction
            - use in two forms: wire and foil

        - Signal Conditioning
            - two important effects critical for signal conditioning
                - fractional changes in resistance require special resistance measurement circuits
                - compensation for temperature change

            - the bridge circuit is the answer to both of these
                - one arm bridge
                    - a dummy gague is used to that we know the resistance of the sensor at
                      the current temperature without any stress applied

                        - the dummy gauge is in one arm of the bridge



                    [ figure 5.10 ]

                - two arm bridge
                    - uses active strain gagues in two arms of the bridge
                    - the resistors in all 4 arms are strain gagues
                        - two are for temperature compensation only

                    delta(V) = (Vs / 2) * GF * (delta(l) / l)

                    - one of the active gagues experiences compression while the other one is
                      stretched

                    [ figure 5.11 ]

                    [ figure 5.12 ]


    3.4 Semiconductor Strain Gagues
        - principles
            - resistivity and physical dimensions changes with strain
                - because of changes in electron hole mobility

            - results in a much larger gauge factor

        - gague factor
            GF = (delta(R)/R) / strain

            - often a negative value for semiconductor
                - resistances decreases with stress

            - These are highly non-linear devices


        - signal conditioning
            - still typicalls a bridge circuit with temperature compensation

    3.5 Load Cells
        - transducer device which measures deformations
