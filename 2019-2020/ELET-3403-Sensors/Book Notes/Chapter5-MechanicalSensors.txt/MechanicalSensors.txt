2. Displacement, Location or Position Sensors
    2.1 Potentiometric Sensors
        - Converts linear or angular motion into a changing resistance
            - A potentiometric displacement sencor is pretty simple.
                - just a wound resistor and a wiper.  Moving the wiper causes motion against the
                  resistor, leading to a different output resistance

    2.2 Capcaitive and Inductive Sensors
        - displacement causes changes in capacity or inductance

        - Capactitive
            - using the capitance equation, we can figure out how the sensor works
                - C = K * Eo * A / d

            - Three cays to change capacity
                - Distance between plates
                - Shared Area of Plates
                - Dielectric Constant

        - Inductance
            - a core is inserted into an inductor
                - this produces a new inductance value
            - as the core moves through the inductor, the inductance value changes




    2.3 Variable-Reluctance Sensors
        - Moving a core produces a varying magnetic flux coupling between two or more coils

        - applications to measure both translational and angular displacement

        - most common configuration is linear variable differential transformer (LVDT)

        - LVDT
            - 3 coils of wire wound on a hollow form
            - core of a permiable material can slide freely through the center of the form
