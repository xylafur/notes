- Summary
    1. The class of sensors that do measurmenets consists mostly of 3 types
        1) Resistance Temperature Detector (RTD)
        2) Thermistor
        3) Thermocouple

    2. Temperature is contained in a body's thermal energy as average thermal
       energy per moledule

       There are 2 different scales where 0 is absolute 0
        1) Kelvin
        2) Rankine


        T(K) = 5/9 * T(R)

    3. There are 2 reactive (absolute 0 energy is not 0 in the scale) temperature scales
        1. Celsuis
            T(C) = T(K) = 273.15

        2. Fahrenheit
            T(F) = T(R) - 459.6

    4. The RTD is a sensor that depends on increase in resistance with
       temperature.

       The increase is very nearly linear.  Resistance vs temperature is
       expressed as either a linear or quadratic equation

       R(T) = R(To)[1 + alpha0 * delta(T)]

       R(T) = R(To)[1 + alpha1 * delta(T) + alpha2 * delta(T)^2]


       When greater accuracy is needed, tables are used instead.

       Usually used with Bridge Circuit or High Gain null Detector

    5. Thermistor is based on a decrease of semiconductor resistance with
       temperature.

       Highly NON LINEAR to temp vs resistance

       Usually used with Bridge Circuit or Op-Amp

    6. Thermocouple is a junction of dissimilar metal wires, usually joined to
       a third metal wire through 2 reference junctions.
        - a voltage is developed across the common metal wires
        - the voltage is nearly linearly proportional to the difference in temp
          between measurement and reference junctions

       Voltage must be measured at high impeadance.

       SIgnal is conditioned with potentiometric, op amps, or other


    7. Bimetal strip can be used to convert temperature into physical motion

    8. Gas and vapor pressure temperature sensors convery temp into gas
    pressure, which is then converted into eleectrical signal or used directly
    by pneumatic systems


1. Introduction

2. Definition of Temperature
    2.1 Thermal Energy
        - thermal energy is determined by the vibrations of molecules.
        - if the molecules are not moving at all, the things is said to have 0
          thermal energy

    2.2 Temperature
        - Joules are how we measure energy in a system (SI unit)
            - The amount of joules in a system would have to do with the size
              of the thing though...

            - consider two cups of water at the same temperature
                - the larger cup would contain more total energy obviously

            - we consider average thermal energy per molecule, expressed in
              joules

        - Temperature scales
            - you need a 'calibration point' to base measurement scales at
                - such as the freezing / melting of oxygen, water, etc


        - Relation to thermal energy
            - temperature can be related to thermal energy using Boltzmann's COnstant
                - not true in call cases, but a good aproximation

                Thermal Energy = W_th = 3/2 * k * T

                    k = 1.38 * 10 ^ -23 J/K

            - From this you can determine the average thermal speed of a gas
              molecule


                1/2 * m * v_th^2 = W_th = 3/2 * k * T

                => v_th = sqrt(3 * k * T / m)


3. Metal Resistance Vs Temperature Devices
    3.1 Metal Resistance vs Temperature
        - The chief characteristic of metal is that each atom gives up its
          valence electron
            - this electron can move reely throughout the material
            - this is called a conduction electron

        - In metals there is overlap in the energy between conduction and valence bands

        - The warmer a material is, the more its atoms vibrate
            - this means that electrons which move through it colide more
              often, this impeades their motion

        - The resistance of a particular metal can be determined with
            R = p * l / A (T = constant)

                R = sample resistance (ohm)
                l = length (m)
                A = cross-sectional area (m^2)
                p = resistivity (ohm * meter)
                    - often given as a function of temperature

    3.2 Resistance vs temperature approximations
        - Linear Aproximation
            - if you have the mid point and know that the temperature equation
              over a range of temperatures is linear, you can use this equation

            R(T) = R(T0)[1 + alpha0 * delta(T)]

                Over the range T1 < T < T2
                T0 is the midpoint temperature
                alpha0 = fractional change in resistance per degree of temperature at T0




    3.3 Resistance-Temperature Detectors
        - sensor that uses resistance to approximate temperature

        - sensitivity
            - can be noted from aplha0

        - response time
            - RTD has a response time of 0.5 to 5 seconds

        - Signal conditioning
            - RTD is generally used in a bridge circuit

            [ See figure 3.1 ]


        - Dissipation Constant
            - There is an (I^2 * R) power dissipated by the device itself
                - this produces a small heating effect

            - this means the current through the RTD must be kept very low and
              constant!

            delta(T) = P / P_D
                delta(T) = rise in temperature because of self-heating
                P = power dissipated in the RTD from the circuit in W
                P_D = dissipation constant of the RTD




4 Thermistors
    - Uses resistance like an RTD, but is a semiconductor


    4.1 Semiconductor Resistance vs Temperature
        - In semiconductors, electrons are bound to each molecule with
          sufficient strength that no conduction electrons are contributed from
          the valence band to the conduction band

            - this is called a gap of energy `delta(W_g)` between conduction
              and valence electrons

            - this behaves as an insulator because no conduction band electrons
              are avaliable to carry charge

        - As temperature is increased, the molecules vibrate
            - the vibration provides more energy to the valence electrons

            - when this energy is greater than delta(W_g) then some of these
              electrons become free of their molecules

            - as the temperature increases, more and more electrons gain energy
              to enter the conduction band


            - this only works because the gap is small compared to conductors

        - Semiconductors become better conductors as temperature increases!
            - the resistance decreases with increasing temperature

        - the relation ship between temp and resistance is highly non-linear
          though!


    4.2 Thermistor Characteristics
        - Sensitivity
            - Very high sensitivity
            - changes in resistance of 10% per degree celcius is not uncommon

        - Range
            - depends on the materials used

            - Three general range limitation effects
                1. Melting or deterioration of the semiconductor
                2. Deterioration of encapsulation material
                3. Insensitivity at higher temperatures


            - semiconductor material may melt or deteriorate as the temperature
              is raised

                - generally limits the upper temp to less than 300 C


            - When temp is very low, the resistance will be VERY high (mega ohms)

            - at higher temperatures the curve flattens out


        - Response time
            - dependent on the quantity of material present and the environment
            - it can vary from .5s to 10s or more

        - Signal Conditioning
            - there are many applications, but often a bridge circuit is used

            - Dissipation Constants are quoted as the power required to raise
              the thermistors temp by 1 degree C
                - vary from 1-10 mV/degree C
