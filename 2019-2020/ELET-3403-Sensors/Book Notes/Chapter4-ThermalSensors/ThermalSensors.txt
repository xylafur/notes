- Summary
    1. The class of sensors that do measurmenets consists mostly of 3 types
        1) Resistance Temperature Detector (RTD)
        2) Thermistor
        3) Thermocouple

    2. Temperature is contained in a body's thermal energy as average thermal
       energy per moledule

       There are 2 different scales where 0 is absolute 0
        1) Kelvin
        2) Rankine


        T(K) = 5/9 * T(R)

    3. There are 2 reactive (absolute 0 energy is not 0 in the scale) temperature scales
        1. Celsuis
            T(C) = T(K) = 273.15

        2. Fahrenheit
            T(F) = T(R) - 459.6

    4. The RTD is a sensor that depends on increase in resistance with
       temperature.

       The increase is very nearly linear.  Resistance vs temperature is
       expressed as either a linear or quadratic equation

       R(T) = R(To)[1 + alpha0 * delta(T)]

       R(T) = R(To)[1 + alpha1 * delta(T) + alpha2 * delta(T)^2]


       When greater accuracy is needed, tables are used instead.

       Usually used with Bridge Circuit or High Gain null Detector

    5. Thermistor is based on a decrease of semiconductor resistance with
       temperature.

       Highly NON LINEAR to temp vs resistance

       Usually used with Bridge Circuit or Op-Amp

    6. Thermocouple is a junction of dissimilar metal wires, usually joined to
       a third metal wire through 2 reference junctions.
        - a voltage is developed across the common metal wires
        - the voltage is nearly linearly proportional to the difference in temp
          between measurement and reference junctions

       Voltage must be measured at high impeadance.

       SIgnal is conditioned with potentiometric, op amps, or other


    7. Bimetal strip can be used to convert temperature into physical motion

    8. Gas and vapor pressure temperature sensors convery temp into gas
    pressure, which is then converted into eleectrical signal or used directly
    by pneumatic systems


1. Introduction

2. Definition of Temperature
    2.1 Thermal Energy
        - thermal energy is determined by the vibrations of molecules.
        - if the molecules are not moving at all, the things is said to have 0
          thermal energy

    2.2 Temperature
        - Joules are how we measure energy in a system (SI unit)
            - The amount of joules in a system would have to do with the size
              of the thing though...

            - consider two cups of water at the same temperature
                - the larger cup would contain more total energy obviously

            - we consider average thermal energy per molecule, expressed in
              joules

        - Temperature scales
            - you need a 'calibration point' to base measurement scales at
                - such as the freezing / melting of oxygen, water, etc


        - Relation to thermal energy
            - temperature can be related to thermal energy using Boltzmann's COnstant
                - not true in call cases, but a good aproximation

                Thermal Energy = W_th = 3/2 * k * T

                    k = 1.38 * 10 ^ -23 J/K

            - From this you can determine the average thermal speed of a gas
              molecule


                1/2 * m * v_th^2 = W_th = 3/2 * k * T

                => v_th = sqrt(3 * k * T / m)


3. Metal Resistance Vs Temperature Devices
    3.1 Metal Resistance vs Temperature
        - The chief characteristic of metal is that each atom gives up its
          valence electron
            - this electron can move reely throughout the material
            - this is called a conduction electron

        - In metals there is overlap in the energy between conduction and valence bands

        - The warmer a material is, the more its atoms vibrate
            - this means that electrons which move through it colide more
              often, this impeades their motion

        - The resistance of a particular metal can be determined with
            R = p * l / A (T = constant)

                R = sample resistance (ohm)
                l = length (m)
                A = cross-sectional area (m^2)
                p = resistivity (ohm * meter)
                    - often given as a function of temperature

    3.2 Resistance vs temperature approximations
        - Linear Aproximation
            - if you have the mid point and know that the temperature equation
              over a range of temperatures is linear, you can use this equation

            R(T) = R(T0)[1 + alpha0 * delta(T)]

                Over the range T1 < T < T2
                T0 is the midpoint temperature
                alpha0 = fractional change in resistance per degree of temperature at T0




    3.3 Resistance-Temperature Detectors
        - sensor that uses resistance to approximate temperature

        - sensitivity
            - can be noted from aplha0

        - response time
            - RTD has a response time of 0.5 to 5 seconds

        - Signal conditioning
            - RTD is generally used in a bridge circuit

            [ See figure 3.1 ]


        - Dissipation Constant
            - There is an (I^2 * R) power dissipated by the device itself
                - this produces a small heating effect

            - this means the current through the RTD must be kept very low and
              constant!

            delta(T) = P / P_D
                delta(T) = rise in temperature because of self-heating
                P = power dissipated in the RTD from the circuit in W
                P_D = dissipation constant of the RTD




4 Thermistors
    - Uses resistance like an RTD, but is a semiconductor


    4.1 Semiconductor Resistance vs Temperature
        - In semiconductors, electrons are bound to each molecule with
          sufficient strength that no conduction electrons are contributed from
          the valence band to the conduction band

            - this is called a gap of energy `delta(W_g)` between conduction
              and valence electrons

            - this behaves as an insulator because no conduction band electrons
              are avaliable to carry charge

        - As temperature is increased, the molecules vibrate
            - the vibration provides more energy to the valence electrons

            - when this energy is greater than delta(W_g) then some of these
              electrons become free of their molecules

            - as the temperature increases, more and more electrons gain energy
              to enter the conduction band


            - this only works because the gap is small compared to conductors

        - Semiconductors become better conductors as temperature increases!
            - the resistance decreases with increasing temperature

        - the relation ship between temp and resistance is highly non-linear
          though!


    4.2 Thermistor Characteristics
        - Sensitivity
            - Very high sensitivity
            - changes in resistance of 10% per degree celcius is not uncommon

        - Range
            - depends on the materials used

            - Three general range limitation effects
                1. Melting or deterioration of the semiconductor
                2. Deterioration of encapsulation material
                3. Insensitivity at higher temperatures


            - semiconductor material may melt or deteriorate as the temperature
              is raised

                - generally limits the upper temp to less than 300 C


            - When temp is very low, the resistance will be VERY high (mega ohms)

            - at higher temperatures the curve flattens out


        - Response time
            - dependent on the quantity of material present and the environment
            - it can vary from .5s to 10s or more

        - Signal Conditioning
            - there are many applications, but often a bridge circuit is used

            - Dissipation Constants are quoted as the power required to raise
              the thermistors temp by 1 degree C
                - vary from 1-10 mV/degree C


5 Thermocouples
    - With the resistance based methods we have covered previously, external
      power is required

    - there are Voltage-generating sensors that will produce a Electromotive Force (emf)
      based on the temperature
        - the emf is almost linear with temperature and very repeatable

        - devices that measure temp with this produced voltage are called
          thermocouples (TC)


    5.1 Thermo-electric Effects
        - temperature difference maintained across a given metal causes the
          vibration of atoms
            - these effects the motion of electrons so that a potential
              difference exists

            - the potential difference is because electrons at the hotter end
              have more energy than electrons at the cooler end
                - this causes electrons to start to drift

            - if a closed circuit is formed with another conductor, this will
              cause current to flow in a closed loop


        - Seebeck Effect
            - an emf has been established in a circuit, causing current to flow

            [ Figure 4.2 ]

            emf = âˆ«(T1 ->T2) (Qa - Qb) dT

                emf = volts produced
                T1, T2 = junction temperatures in K
                Qa, Qb = Thermal Transport constants of the two metals


            - if the difference between the temperatures of between the two
              constants is 0, the produced voltage will be 0

            - the constants are nearly independent of temperature, so this
              approximate linear relationship exists:
                emf = alpha * (T2 - T1)

                alpha = constant in V/K
            


        - Peltier Effect
            - The opposite of Seebeck effect
            - if you apply a voltage to the same setup, one of the sides of the
              device will be heated while the other is cooled


    5.2 Thermocouple Characteristics
        - a definite relationship needs to be established between the emf and
          the unknown temperature

        - Devices connected to the thermocouple loop will contribute to the emf

        - the arrangment used to good definite results
            - you have the two different metals with known constants, A and B
              which meet together at the point where you measure

            - then you have a point where you apply a known reference
              temperature

            - then you have a third known metal that connects to both sides

            - you can also extend the wires


        [ Figure 4.3 ]


        - Both magnitude and sign of the voltage must be noted!
            - if the temerature of the measure side is lower than the reference
              then the sign will be flipped!


        - You must hold the reference temp at a (reasonably) constant value!

        - Thermocouple Types
            - Thermocouples are grouped into categories with a 'character type'
                - like a J type or T type thermocouple

                - Each of these types is suited for a particular range


            - Some types are non-linear with respect to particaulr ranges


            - J and K types are very sensitive

            - S type has a much larger range


        - Thermocouple Polarity
            - Depending on the type of thermocouple, the expected polarity will
              be different

        - Thermocouple Tables
            - gives the expected voltage that results for a particular type
              thermocouple at a particular temperature

            - To find a temerature for a point that is not indie the table, use
              two poins close to that value and this equation

                Tm = Tl + [ (Th - Tl) / (Vh - Vl) ] * (Vm - Vl)

            - Use the oposite to obtain the voltage if needed
                
                Vm = Vl + [ (Vh - Vl) / (Th - Tl) ] * (Tm - Tl)


        - Change in Table Reference
            - Tables are prepared for thermocouple of a particular type with a
              particular reference temperature

            - you can adjust to a different reference temperature with a shift
              of the table scale

            - Correction factor = voltage at new reference temp based on old
                                  reference


    5.3 Thermocouple Sensors
        - Sensitivity
            - range of voltages is usually less than 100mV
            - sensitivity depends on signial conditioning and the TC

            Type J: 0.05 mV / degree C
            Type S: 0.006 mV / degree C


        - Construction
            - usually just the two pieces welded or twisted together
            - sometimes has a protective sheath

        - Range
            - has greatest range of all types considered so far


        - Time Response
            - related to the size of the wire, and any protective material used
              with the sensor
                - How long it takes the TC to reach thermal EQ with the env

        - Signal Conditioning
            - needs considerable amplification because the output signal is so
              small

            - because of the small signal, very suseptible to noise

            - usually used with a high gain differential amplifier


        - Reference Compensation
            - you have to know the reference temperature to use thermocouples

            - these techniques are used for reference junction compensation
                1. Controlled Temperature Reference Block
                    - Many times many thermocouples are used and extended to
                      all connect into a single room with a known reference
                      temp
                2. Reference Compensation Circuits
                    - specialized ICs that add or subtract the correction
                      factor directly to TC output

                    - These ICs have their own reference temperatures that they
                      compare against the global reference temp
                        - this secondary reference is often called a "Cold
                          Junction COmpensator" or "Ice Point Compensator"


                3. Software Reference Correction
                    - reference junction temp can be measured with a precision
                      thermistor or other IC temperature sensor and provided as
                      input to the computer

                    - Software then takes care of corrections to the
                      thermocouple's temperature signal


        - Noise
            - THe thermocouple acts as an excelent antena to pick up electrical
              noise

            - A number of noise reduction techniques are used in the industry

                1. The extention or lead wires from the thermocouple to the
                   reference junction are twisted and then wrapped in grounded
                   foil sheath

                2. The measurement junction is grounded at the point of
                   measurement.  The grounding is typically the inside of a
                   stainless steel sheath that covers the thermo couple

                3. An instrument amplifier that has excellent common mode
                   rejection is used for measurement
