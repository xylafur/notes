1. Introduction
    - non local / nocontact measurement systems
        - no physical contact is made with enviornment of the variable
        - measurements of this type can be made from a distance

2. Fundamentals of EM Radiation
    - most sensors are in teh infared, visable and ultraviolet range

    2.1 Nature of EM Radiation
        - energy that is always in motion
            - propogates through space

        - an object that emits radiation loses energy
        - an object that absorbs radiation gains energy


        - Speed of Propogation
            - c = lambda * frequency

            - propogation velocity is reduced when EM waves travel through a medium
            - the new velocity is indicated by the index of refraction


    2.2 Characteristics of Light
        - Photon
            - EM radiation can only propgate only in discrete quantities
