1 - Introduction
    - We need to condition process contrl signals to be an appropriate digital
      fromat

    - we lose some accuracy when we convert to digital format, but we are much
      more immune to the various type of noise (and other problems) that can be
      introduced

    2.2 Successive Multiplication
        # TODO: READ ME

    2.3 Boolean Algebra
        - We want to develop a system that can operate on many true / false
          values
            - it uses those values to determine its operation


3 Converters
    3.1 Comparators
        - compares to input analog voltage and outputs:
            1 if Va > Vb
            0 if Va < Vb

        - Open Collector Comparators
            [ Figure 3.1 ]

            - There is a transistor internal to the comparitor
                - the collector of the transistor is connected to the output
                - the emitter to ground
                - the base is connected to the input somehow

            - You have a pull up resistor attached to the output (since the
              collector is attached to output, if the transistor is activated
              then the current will flow from the pull up to ground through the
              emitter)

        - Hysteresis Comparitor
            - If the signal has noise or opproaches the reference too slowly
                - the comparator output may jiggle between ehigh and low as it
                  reaches the reference value

                [ Figure 3.2 ]

            - This is solved by providing a "deadband" or "hysteresis" window

                - when the comparitor goes high, the threshold by which is
                  required to go low again is lowered

                - hysteresis can be provided in many ways
                    - Feedback resistor Rf, between the output and one of the
                      inputs of the comparator

                        [ Figure 3.3 ]

                        - the input is seperated from the signal by another
                          resistor R

                        - If Rf >> R, then  the output is like the graph in
                          Figure 3.3
                        
                        - The output to drive the comparitor high is given by
                            Vin >= Vref

                        - After the comparitor output goes high, the condition
                          changes to
                            Vin <= Vref - (R / Rf) * Vo

                        - The deadband or hysteresis is then given by (R/Rf)*Vo



    3.2 Digital To Analog Converters
        - Accepts digital information and transforms it into an analog value

        - The reference voltage determines the max output
            Vout = Vr * [ 2 ^ w1 + b2 * 2 ^ -2 + b3 * 2 ^ -3 + ... ]

            - the number of elements depends on the number of bits in the
              binary word

            - the eminimum output is thus 0, and the max depends on Vr and the
              number of bits


        - An equivalent equation is
            Vout  = (N / 2^n) * Vr
                - N is th ebase 10 whole numebr equivalent of the DAC input


        - Bipolar DAC
            - some DACs are designed to output a voltage that ranges from +-
              some max

            - This does not use 2s compliment
            - Bipolar DACs use an "offset-binary"

                Vout = (N/2^n) * Vr - (1/2) * Vr

            - so if N is 0, then the output is some minimum value

        - Conversion Resolution
            - function of the reference voltage and the number of bits in the
              word
            - the more bits, the smaller the change in analog output

            - if we have more bits the resolution for a 1 bit change will be
              much greater

            Resolution = Vr * 2 ^ (-n)


        - DAC Characteristics
        - DAC Structure
            - treat it as a black box

            - Can be implementedusing a series of op amps, but often are
              implemented using a "resistive ladder"

                - see the resistive ladder in the picture below

              [ Figure 3.4 ]
            

    3.3 Analog to Digital Converters
        - most sensors still produce an analog signal

        - an ADC can be expressed in a way similar to an DAC, but the
          interpretation is reversed

            b1 * 2^-1 + b2 * 2^-2 + ... + bn * n^-n <= Vin / Vr

        - We can find the value read by an ADC using the equation:
            N  = floor(Vin / Vr * 2^n)

        - Bipolar Operation
            - Also uses offset-binary
                - this means that the normal output is simply shifted by half
                  the scale

                - all 0's means lowest negative value instead of zero
                - all 1's means highest positive value



            N = floor( (Vin / Vr + 1/2) * 2^n )

            1000....0 will be equal to 0V

        - ADC Characteristics

        - Parallel-Feedback ADC
            - feedback system that performs the conversion

            - a comparator compares the input voltage to the output voltage of
              an internal DAC

            - doesn't count.
                - Iterate through all bits, starting at MSB working down
                    - set this bit to 1

                    - if the output from the DAC is > than input
                        - change this bit to 0
                    - if this is < than input
                        - leave it at 1

        - Ramp ADC
            - Compare the input voltage against a linearly increasing ramp
              voltage

            - There is a binary counter that counts the ramp steps

            - The ramp is implemented using an op amp integrator circuit

        - Dual Slope Ramp ADC
            - Most common type of ramp converter

            - Operates as the input signal drives an integrator for a fixed
              time
                - This makes the output of the integrator a constant

                    V1 = 1 / RC = R1 * Vx

            - THen the input to the integrator switches from the input signal
              to the reference voltage

            - This value will be continually subtracted from the original
              voltage over time

            - the result of the ADC is then determined by the time it took for
              the differences of the voltages to reach 0

                Vx = tx / T1 * Vr




            - so the counter time is linearly releated to Vr but independent of
              the specifics of the integrator

            - Has a much longer convertion time than successive approximation
              type (such as ramp and parallel feedback)


        - Conversion Time Consequences
            - the finite conversion time has serious consequences

            - ADC output will be in error if the magnitude of the input voltage
              changes by more than one LSB voltage during the time conversion
                - if the input voltage changes by delta(V) or more during
                  conversion time TauC, there are problems
