1 - Introduction
    - signal conditioning is the operations performed on signals in order to
      get them into a suitable state for interfacing with other elements

    - We are interested only analog conversions, that is where the output is
      still analog

2 - Principles of Analog Signal Conditioning
    - Signal Conditioning is often refered to as a transfer function

    2.1 Signal Level Bias Changes
        - The most common signal conditioning modifies these features of a
          voltage representing a process variable

            - Adjusting the level
                - magnitude
            - Bias
                - zero value
                - change the 'y-intercept' so to speak

        - For instance we may need to transfer values from the range (0.2V,
          0.6V) to (0V, 5V)
            - we first change the zero value by adding or subtracting
            - then we multiply the range to equal the other
                - this can either be amplification or attenuation (making the
                  signal smaller value)

    2.2 Linearization
        - When devices are 'nearly linear' this can cause alot of problems

        - nowadays a signal is made linear using software

    2.3 Conversions
        - Many sensors exhibit changes of resistance with changes in a dynamic
          variable
            - In these cases, a circuit must be built to convert the change in
              resistance to either voltage or current

            - this is usually done using bridges

        - Signal Transmission
            - Since we generally use 4-20 mA as standard signal, we have to
              convert to current at transmistting end and to voltage at the
              receiving end

            - Current is used because it is independent of load

        - Digital Interface
            - ADCs often convert from analog to digital

            - sometimes you have to add some gain to the signal before feeding
              it into a ADC
                - the ADC may expect a much different range than the actual
                  value you are trying to measure


    2.4 Filtering and Impedance Matching
        - often interfearance signal of considerable strength are present in
          industrial enviornments

        - it is necessary to use high-pass, low-pass or notch filters to
          eliminate unwanted signals

        - there are two filter type
            - passive
                - uses resistors, capacitors and inductors

            - active
                - use gain and feedback

        - Impeadance Matching
            - important when transducer internal impeadance or line impeadance
              can cause errors in measurment of dynamic variable

    2.5 Concept of Loading
        - loading one circuit by another can cause significant problems
            - introduces uncertainty in the amplitude of the voltage

        - The load can be reduced into a Thevenin equivalent circuit
            [ Figure 2.1 ]
            [ Figure 2.2 ]

        


3 Passive Circuits
    - Bridge Circuits
        - Used for measuring changes in impeadance
            - especially when the changes are very small

    - Filter
        - a resistor and capacitor can be used to filter out noise

    - Divider Circuits

    3.1 Divider Circuits
        - can convert resistance variation into voltage variation


            Vd = (R2 * Vs) / (R1 + R2)

        - Issues with voltage dividers
            1. Vd does not vary linearly even if the resistance does!
            2. the total output impeadance (R2 || R2) may not be high, so
               loading effects must be considered

            3. Current will flow through both resistors
                - Power will be dissipated by both!
                - You must consider the power rating for both


    3.2 Bridge Circuits
        - Covert impeadance variations into voltage variations

        - can be designed so output voltage varies around 0

        - precise static measurement of impedance


        - Wheatstone Bridge
            - most common and simplest bridge circuit

            - used in applications where sensor changes resistance with process
              variable changes

            [ Figure 2.3 ]

            - We start by assuming that the detector has an infinite input
              impedance
                - this means that the potential difference between the two
                  points that we are measuring (a and b, see the figure) is
                  just the subtraction of the voltage at the two points
                    - delta(V) = Va - Vb

                - Va and Vb can both be found using the voltage divider
                  principles

                    Va = (VR3 / (R1 + R3))
                    Vb = (VR4 / (R2 + R4))

                - The Bridge "Nulls" when R1 * R4 = R3 * R2
                    - this null occurs when the voltage difference across the
                      detector is 0


            - Galvanometer Detector
                - If we use a galvanometer as a null detector this induces some changes
                    - the galvometer has very low resistance
                    - we must determine the bridge offset as current offset
                        - the easiest way to find this, is to find the thevenin
                          equivalent circuit between points a and b of the
                          bridge

                        Vth = V { ( R3 * R2 - R1 * R4) } / { (R1 + R3) * (R2 + R4) }

                    - this equation allows us to easily determine the current
                      through any galvanometer with internal resistance Rg
                        Ig = (Vth) / (Rth + Rg)


            - Bridge Resolution
                - the resolution of a the bridge circuit is a function of the
                  resolution of the detector used to determine the bridge
                  offset
                    - voltage offset: resolution is resistance
                        - defined as "resistance change in one arm of the bridge
                          that causes an offset voltage that is equal to the
                          resolution of the detector"

                        - depending on the minimum voltage that the detector
                          can detect, this sets a limit on the minimum
                          measurable resistance

                        - this resistance change can also be called the
                          accuracy of the instrument, since it is the minimum
                          detectable change

                            - concept applies for galvanometer but with current

            - Lead Compensation
                - often times the sensor is located a considerable distance
                  from the bridge circuit
                  
                - the fixed bridge resistors can be selected to account for
                  resistance of leads to attach the sensor to the bridge
                    - we can use this to account for lead resistance

                - there are certain things that aren't easy to account for
                  though
                    - things like frequency and chemicals can cause the lead
                      resistance to change on a transient basis

                @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
                @ Question: I should probably know this, but what is a bridge
                @           offset?
                @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

                    - these show up as a bridge offset
                    - you get around this with "Lead COmpenstation"
                        - if you induce the changes to both arms of the bridge
                          you will cancel out the change in bridge offset


            - Current Balance Bridge
                - There used to be circuits where the the offset would be
                  amplified and driven through a motor that turned a variable
                  resistor
                    - this is really slow

                - THere is another, more modern method, which uses current to
                  null the bridge

                [ Figure 2.4 ]

                - the resistors R4 and R5 are such that most of the current at
                  the junction flows through R5
                    - this can be done by making `R4 >> R5`


            - Potential Measurements Using Bridges
                - bridge circuits are useful to measure small potentials at
                  very high impedance

                    - place the thing to be measured in series with the
                      detector

                [ figure 2.5 ]

                - Vc is calculated to be
                    Vc = Vx + Va

                - The voltage appearing across the null detector
                    delta(V) = Vc - Vb = Vx + va - Vb

                    - the null bridge occurs when this happens


           
            - ac bridges
                - The same thing that we did with resistance, but we do it with
                  impedance

            - Bridge Applications
                - the primary application is to convery variations of
                  resistance into variations of voltage

                    - after this the voltage is then conditioned even further

                - the variation of bridge offset is nonlinear with respect to
                  any of the resistors
                    - so any linearlity is lost when converting resistance or
                      impedance to voltage

                    - if the change in resistance is small, then the voltage is
                      basically linear

    3.3 RC Filters
        - filters are circuits that block certain frequencies or bands of
          frequencies

            - a simple filter can be constructed with a single resistor and a
              single capacitor

        - critical frequency
            - frequency for which the ratio of the output to input voltage is
              approxamitely 0.707

            - given by
                fc = 1 / (2 * pi * R * C)


        - Low Pass RC Filter
            - blocks high frequencies and passes low frequencies

            - the cuttoff point isn't exact, its more like a range over which
              the amplitude of certain frequencies is diminished until it
              approaches 0


        - design methods
            - typically filter design is started by finding the critical
              frequency that will satisfy criteria

            - since there are two unknowns, R and C, generally one component is
              selected and then the other

                1. Select a standard cap value in the uF to pF range
                2. Clculate the required resistance value
                    - if it is below 1k ohm of above 1m ohm select a different
                      capacitor so that the resistor falls within that range
                3. use the nearest standard value of resistance if possible
                4. Consider the tolerance of the cap and res

        - High Pass RC Filter
            - passes high frequencies and blocks low frequencies
            - can be constructed using a resistor and a capacitor
                - again the rejection is not sharp but occurs over a range
                  around the critical frequency


        - Practical considerations
            - problems that arise when designing low and high pass filters

            1. After the critical frequency is determined, R and C are
               selected.  THings that limit this are
                a. small resistances are bad
                    - they lead to high current
                    - resulting in loading
                    - try to keep resistance in k ohm and above range
                  
                  small caps are also bad
                    - try to keep cap in uF and below range
                b. If you actually need exact value for the critical frequency,
                   then select the cap first and then use a trimmer resistor

            2. The effective I/O impedance of the RC filter may have an effect
               on the circuit because of loading

            3. You can cascade RC filters in series to get better results
                - you have to consider the loading of one RC on the other
                  though
                - the output impedance of the first stage must be MUCH less
                  than the input impedance of the next stage to avoid loading


        - Band Pass RC filter
            - blocks frequencies above a high limit and below a low limit

            - passive versions use caps and res
                - even better versions can use caps and inductors

            - can simply be a low pass filter followed by a high pass filter
                - make suer that you consider the practical considerations
                  though

        - Band Reject
            - difficult to realize with RC combinations

            - notch filter
                - type of band reject that can be realized with only RC
                  components

                - blocks a very narrow band of frequencies

                - called a "twin T filter"

                - characteristics are deteremined strongly by the valu of the
                  grounding resistor and capacitor

                - the critical "notch" frequency occurs at
                    fn = 0.785 fc
                    fc = 1 / (2 * pi * R * C)
