1 - Introduction
    - signal conditioning is the operations performed on signals in order to
      get them into a suitable state for interfacing with other elements

    - We are interested only analog conversions, that is where the output is
      still analog

2 - Principles of Analog Signal Conditioning
    - Signal Conditioning is often refered to as a transfer function

    2.1 Signal Level Bias Changes
        - The most common signal conditioning modifies these features of a
          voltage representing a process variable

            - Adjusting the level
                - magnitude
            - Bias
                - zero value
                - change the 'y-intercept' so to speak

        - For instance we may need to transfer values from the range (0.2V,
          0.6V) to (0V, 5V)
            - we first change the zero value by adding or subtracting
            - then we multiply the range to equal the other
                - this can either be amplification or attenuation (making the
                  signal smaller value)

    2.2 Linearization
        - When devices are 'nearly linear' this can cause alot of problems

        - nowadays a signal is made linear using software

    2.3 Conversions
        - Many sensors exhibit changes of resistance with changes in a dynamic
          variable
            - In these cases, a circuit must be built to convert the change in
              resistance to either voltage or current

            - this is usually done using bridges

        - Signal Transmission
            - Since we generally use 4-20 mA as standard signal, we have to
              convert to current at transmistting end and to voltage at the
              receiving end

            - Current is used because it is independent of load

        - Digital Interface
            - ADCs often convert from analog to digital

            - sometimes you have to add some gain to the signal before feeding
              it into a ADC
                - the ADC may expect a much different range than the actual
                  value you are trying to measure


    2.4 Filtering and Impedance Matching
        - often interfearance signal of considerable strength are present in
          industrial enviornments

        - it is necessary to use high-pass, low-pass or notch filters to
          eliminate unwanted signals

        - there are two filter type
            - passive
                - uses resistors, capacitors and inductors

            - active
                - use gain and feedback

        - Impeadance Matching
            - important when transducer internal impeadance or line impeadance
              can cause errors in measurment of dynamic variable

    2.5 Concept of Loading
        - loading one circuit by another can cause significant problems
            - introduces uncertainty in the amplitude of the voltage

        - The load can be reduced into a Thevenin equivalent circuit
            [ Figure 2.1 ]
            [ Figure 2.2 ]

        


3 Passive Circuits
    - Bridge Circuits
        - Used for measuring changes in impeadance
            - especially when the changes are very small

    - Filter
        - a resistor and capacitor can be used to filter out noise

    - Divider Circuits

    3.1 Divider Circuits
        - can convert resistance variation into voltage variation


            Vd = (R2 * Vs) / (R1 + R2)

        - Issues with voltage dividers
            1. Vd does not vary linearly even if the resistance does!
            2. the total output impeadance (R2 || R2) may not be high, so
               loading effects must be considered

            3. Current will flow through both resistors
                - Power will be dissipated by both!
                - You must consider the power rating for both


    3.2 Bridge Circuits
        - Covert impeadance variations into voltage variations

        - can be designed so output voltage varies around 0

        - precise static measurement of impedance


        - Wheatstone Bridge
            - most common and simplest bridge circuit

            - used in applications where sensor changes resistance with process
              variable changes

            [ Figure 2.3 ]

            - We start by assuming that the detector has an infinite input
              impedance
                - this means that the potential difference between the two
                  points that we are measuring (a and b, see the figure) is
                  just the subtraction of the voltage at the two points
                    - delta(V) = Va - Vb

                - Va and Vb can both be found using the voltage divider
                  principles

                    Va = (VR3 / (R1 + R3))
                    Vb = (VR4 / (R2 + R4))

                - The Bridge "Nulls" when R1 * R4 = R3 * R2
                    - this null occurs when the voltage difference across the
                      detector is 0


            - Galvanometer Detector
                - If we use a galvanometer as a null detector this induces some changes
                    - the galvometer has very low resistance
                    - we must determine the bridge offset as current offset
                        - the easiest way to find this, is to find the thevenin
                          equivalent circuit between points a and b of the
                          bridge

                        Vth = V { ( R3 * R2 - R1 * R4) } / { (R1 + R3) * (R2 + R4) }

                    - this equation allows us to easily determine the current
                      through any galvanometer with internal resistance Rg
                        Ig = (Vth) / (Rth + Rg)


            - Bridge Resolution
                - the resolution of a the bridge circuit is a function of the
                  resolution of the detector used to determine the bridge
                  offset
                    - voltage offset: resolution is resistance
                        - defined as "resistance change in one arm of the bridge
                          that causes an offset voltage that is equal to the
                          resolution of the detector"

                        - depending on the minimum voltage that the detector
                          can detect, this sets a limit on the minimum
                          measurable resistance

                        - this resistance change can also be called the
                          accuracy of the instrument, since it is the minimum
                          detectable change

                            - concept applies for galvanometer but with current

            - Lead Compensation
                - often times the sensor is located a considerable distance
                  from the bridge circuit
                  
                - the fixed bridge resistors can be selected to account for
                  resistance of leads to attach the sensor to the bridge
                    - we can use this to account for lead resistance

                - there are certain things that aren't easy to account for
                  though
                    - things like frequency and chemicals can cause the lead
                      resistance to change on a transient basis

                @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
                @ Question: I should probably know this, but what is a bridge
                @           offset?
                @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

                    - these show up as a bridge offset
                    - you get around this with "Lead COmpenstation"
                        - if you induce the changes to both arms of the bridge
                          you will cancel out the change in bridge offset


            - Current Balance Bridge
                - There used to be circuits where the the offset would be
                  amplified and driven through a motor that turned a variable
                  resistor
                    - this is really slow

                - THere is another, more modern method, which uses current to
                  null the bridge

                [ Figure 2.4 ]

                - the resistors R4 and R5 are such that most of the current at
                  the junction flows through R5
                    - this can be done by making `R4 >> R5`


            - Potential Measurements Using Bridges
                - bridge circuits are useful to measure small potentials at
                  very high impedance

                    - place the thing to be measured in series with the
                      detector

                [ figure 2.5 ]

                - Vc is calculated to be
                    Vc = Vx + Va

                - The voltage appearing across the null detector
                    delta(V) = Vc - Vb = Vx + va - Vb

                    - the null bridge occurs when this happens


           
            - ac bridges
                - The same thing that we did with resistance, but we do it with
                  impedance

            - Bridge Applications
                - the primary application is to convery variations of
                  resistance into variations of voltage

                    - after this the voltage is then conditioned even further

                - the variation of bridge offset is nonlinear with respect to
                  any of the resistors
                    - so any linearlity is lost when converting resistance or
                      impedance to voltage

                    - if the change in resistance is small, then the voltage is
                      basically linear

    3.3 RC Filters
        - filters are circuits that block certain frequencies or bands of
          frequencies

            - a simple filter can be constructed with a single resistor and a
              single capacitor

        - critical frequency
            - frequency for which the ratio of the output to input voltage is
              approxamitely 0.707

            - given by
                fc = 1 / (2 * pi * R * C)


        - Low Pass RC Filter
            - blocks high frequencies and passes low frequencies

            - the cuttoff point isn't exact, its more like a range over which
              the amplitude of certain frequencies is diminished until it
              approaches 0


        - design methods
            - typically filter design is started by finding the critical
              frequency that will satisfy criteria

            - since there are two unknowns, R and C, generally one component is
              selected and then the other

                1. Select a standard cap value in the uF to pF range
                2. Clculate the required resistance value
                    - if it is below 1k ohm of above 1m ohm select a different
                      capacitor so that the resistor falls within that range
                3. use the nearest standard value of resistance if possible
                4. Consider the tolerance of the cap and res

        - High Pass RC Filter
            - passes high frequencies and blocks low frequencies
            - can be constructed using a resistor and a capacitor
                - again the rejection is not sharp but occurs over a range
                  around the critical frequency


        - Practical considerations
            - problems that arise when designing low and high pass filters

            1. After the critical frequency is determined, R and C are
               selected.  THings that limit this are
                a. small resistances are bad
                    - they lead to high current
                    - resulting in loading
                    - try to keep resistance in k ohm and above range
                  
                  small caps are also bad
                    - try to keep cap in uF and below range
                b. If you actually need exact value for the critical frequency,
                   then select the cap first and then use a trimmer resistor

            2. The effective I/O impedance of the RC filter may have an effect
               on the circuit because of loading

            3. You can cascade RC filters in series to get better results
                - you have to consider the loading of one RC on the other
                  though
                - the output impedance of the first stage must be MUCH less
                  than the input impedance of the next stage to avoid loading


        - Band Pass RC filter
            - blocks frequencies above a high limit and below a low limit

            - passive versions use caps and res
                - even better versions can use caps and inductors

            - can simply be a low pass filter followed by a high pass filter
                - make suer that you consider the practical considerations
                  though

        - Band Reject
            - difficult to realize with RC combinations

            - notch filter
                - type of band reject that can be realized with only RC
                  components

                - blocks a very narrow band of frequencies

                - called a "twin T filter"

                - characteristics are deteremined strongly by the valu of the
                  grounding resistor and capacitor

                - the critical "notch" frequency occurs at
                    fn = 0.785 fc
                    fc = 1 / (2 * pi * R * C)


Operational Amplifiers
    - if impedance transformations, amplification and other operations s




    4.1 Op Amp Characteristics
        - Transfer Function
            - The output voltage is the difference between the two input
              voltages

            - saturation voltage
                - when one is much greater than the other, the output will
                  become the saturation voltage

                    - V1 = Non Inverting INput
                    - V2 = Inverting INput

                    - if V1 >> V2
                        - Vout = + Vsat

                    - if V2 >> V1
                        - Vout = - Vsat


                - The range of input voltage between the saturation is very
                  narrow
                    - thw range is less than a millivolt for many op amps
                    - saturation voltage is usually > 10 V
                        - this means the slope for the output voltages is huge!

            - Input Impedances are very high (typically 1 M ohm)
            - Output Impedance is very low (typically less than 100 ohm)

            - In an ideal op amp
                - inpedance between the two inputs is infinite
                - impedance at the output is 0

            - Feedback from output to input is almost always used

        - Ideal Inverting Amplifier
            [ Figure 2.6 ]

            - R2 is the feedback resistor
                - feeds back output to inverting input

            - R1 connects the input voltage to the point where we feedback
                - also on the inverting input

            - summing point
                - where the feedback portion connects to the input


            - Non-Inverting Input is connected to ground

            - Without feedback
                - Vin > 0 saturates the output negative
                - Vin < 0 saturates the output positive

            - With Feedback
                - Voltages are adjusted such that
                    1. The summing point voltage is equal to the (+) input
                        - in this case its 0 because (+) is tied to ground

                    2. No current flows through the op amp input terminals
                       because of assumed infinite input impedance


                        - Sum of Currents at Summing Point
                            I1 + I2 = 0

                            I1 = Current through R1
                            I2 = Current through R2


            - Attenuator
                - Oposite of an amplifier
                - reduces the output of something by some factor

            - Because potential at summing point is 0
                Vin / R1 + Vout / R2 = 0 => Vout = - (R2 / R1) * Vin

                - This OpAmp is thus
                    - an inverting op amp
                    - Gain of R2 / R1
                    - Output is shifted 180 degrees in phase with the input
                    - The device functions as an attenuator
                        - R2 < R1


            - Design Rules for analyzing Ideal Operation of Op Amp Circuit
                1. Assume that no current flows through the op amp input
                   terminals

                2. Assume that there is no voltage difference between the op
                amp input terminals

        - Open Loop Gain
            - gain when no feedback is provided to the circuit
            

        - Nonideal Effects
             1. Finite Open Loop Gain
                - when we design with an ideal we assume infinite open loop gain
                - in reality the open loop gain is finite

            2. Finite Input Impedance
                - a real op amp has finite imput impedance 

            3. Nonzero Output Impedance
                - generally the output impedance of a op amp is in the ohm
                  range

            - We can ignore alot of these non-ideal effects for the most part


            [ Figure 2.7 ]
                - We can see that
                    I1 + I2 + I3 = 0

                - We can determine the Volrage / resistance or impedance values
                  for the current

                    (Vin - Vs) / R1 + (Vo - Vs) / R2 - Vs / Zin = 0

                - We can then determine the relationship between output and
                  input
                    Vo = A * Vs - Zo * (Vo - Vs) / R2

                    Vo = -(R2 / R1) * Vin * (1 - u)

                - we can find m then
                    m = (1 + Zo/R2)(1 + (R2/R1) + (R2/Zin)) / (A + (Zo / R2))

                    - "m" will be must less than 1


    4.2 Op Amp Specifications
        - these characteristics are given in the spec sheet for a particular op
          amp


        - Input offset Voltage
            - the output voltage of the op amp might not be 0 when the voltage
              across the input is 0

            - the Input Offset Voltage is the voltage that must be applied
              across the input terminals to get the output to 0

        - Input Offset Current
            - Same idea as input offset voltage but with current

            - Sometimes we need a current to get the voltage offset to 0


        - Input Bias Curent
            - the average of the two input currents required to drive the
              output voltage to 0

        - Slew Rate
            - Rate at which the output changes to the saturation value

            - typically expressed as volts per microsecond

            - When a voltage is applied suddenly to the input of an op amp the
              output will saturate to maximum


        - Unity Gain Frequency Bandwidth
            - The frequency response of an op am p is typically defined by a
              bode plot of open loop voltage gain vs frequency



        - Practical Issues
            - other issues associated with op amps that don't contribute to the
              transfer function

            - Op Amps need bipolar power supply
                - generally in range to 9 - 15 V

            - compensation for input offset voltage
                - there are often pins on the chip for this
                - the transfer function willbe incorrect for dc signals if
                  there is input offset voltage

                - if there aren't special pins then you have to actually supply
                  the voltage to the input pins


            - Source and Sinking Current
                - IC op amps can generally source or sink no more than 20mA

                - this is why we want to use resistors in the k ohm range



5 - Op Amp Circuits in Instrumentation
    5.1 Voltage Follower
        - The voltage output tracks the input over a range defined by the plus
          and minus saturation voltage outputs


        [ figure 2.8 ]
 
    
        - essentially an impedance transformer
            - converts a voltage at high impedance to the same voltage at low
              impedance


    5.2 Inverting Amplifier
        - Inverts the input signal
        - May have either attenuation or gain
            - depends on the ratio of the resistances

        - input impedance is essentially equal to R1

        - Summing Amplifier
            - Sums two or more applied voltages

                Vout = - [ (R2/R1) * V1 + (R2/R3) * V2 ]


                [ figure 2.9 ]

    5.3 Noninverting Amplifier
        - Just slap another inverting OpAmp after the inverting OpAmp we use to
          sum and then you get the non-inverting OpAmp circuit

        Vout = [ 1 + (R2/R1) ] * Vin

        - from this we see that you can never achieve attenuation with a
          noninverting OpAmp!


    5.4 Differential Instrumentation Amplifier
        - An ideal differential Amplieifer
            - provides output voltage with respect to ground that is

            Vout = A * (Va - Vb)

            - so takes the difference between the input voltages and applies a
              gain

        @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
        @ Don't quite understand this  @
        @ next part.. need to revisit  @
        @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

        - Common Mode Rejection
            - notice that our output is based on the difference of the two
              inputs.
                - so (Va=3, Vb=2) would have the same output as (Va=20, Vb=19)


            - Common Mode Input Voltage
                - the average of voltage applied to the two terminals

                Vcm = (Va + Vb) / 2


                - Ideal Diff-OpAmp will not have any output that depeneds on
                  value of the common-mode voltage

                    - the circuit gain for common-mode voltage, Acm, will = 0
                        Acm = 0


            - Common Mode Rejection Ratio
                - the ratio of the differential gain to the common-mode gain

                - it is expressed in dB

                CMRR = A / Acm

                CMR = 20 * log_base_10(CMRR)





        - Differential Amplifier
            - Vout = (R2 / R1) * (V2 - V1)

            - If the resistors are not well matched then the CMR will be poor

            - There is a common problem with impedance mismatch between the two
              inputs of a differential amplifier
                - for this reason a voltage follower is added to each of the
                  inputs

                - this gives both of the inputs a high impedance


                [ figure 2.10 ]



        - Instrumentation Amplifier
            - Differential amplifiers with high input impedance and low output
              impedance

            - to change gain you have to change to resistors
                @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
                @ Not 100% sure why, think it has to do   @

            - bias voltage should be provided by a resistance divider and
              regulated power supply

                - a zener diode can be used to provide stability


            - you can construct a instrumentation amplifier that allows the
              gain to be changed with only a single transistor

                [ figure 2.11 ]

        


    5.5 Voltage to Current Converter
        - this is usefuly because signals for process contrl are often sent as
          currents

        - there is a circuit we can use to generate current from voltage input

            [ figure 2.12 ]


        - The current generated is given by

            I = - (R2 / (R1 * R3)) * Vin

        - The selected resistances must be such that

            R1 * ( R3 + R5 ) = R2 * R4



        - Maximum load resistance and maximum current are determined by the
          condition that the amplifier saturates in voltage

            - when the op amp output voltage saturates, maximum load resistance is

                Rml = ( (R4 + R5) * ( (Vsat / Im) - R3) ) / (R3 + R4 + R5)


                Rml: Maximum Load Resistance
                Vsat: Op Amp Saturation on Voltage
                Im: Maxmimum Current





    5.6 Current to Voltage Converter
        - we might need to go the other way too

        Vout = -I * R


        - this is basically just an inverting op amp but with a resistor in
          between noninverting input and ground

        [ figure 2.13 ]



        - the resistor on the non inverting input is there to provide
          temperature stability

    5.7 Integrator

        [ figure 2.14 ]
        
        - We have an input resistor and a feedback capacitor

        - we can sum up the currents at the summing point as

            (Vin / R) + C * derivative(Vout, dt) = 0


        - we can then solve for Vout by integrating both terms

            Vout = - 1 / (RC) * integral(Vin, dt)


        - the output voltage varies as an integral of the input voltage with a
          scale factor of: -1 / (RC)


        - If the voltage is constant then

            Vout = - K / (RC) * t

            - this is a linear ramp with nagative slope of K/RC


    5.8 Differentiator 
        - also realized with a single capacitor and resistor, but in swapped
          positions from the integrator


        C * derivative(Vin, dt) + Vout / R = 0

        Vout = - RC * derivative(Vin, dt)


        [ figure 2.15 ]

    
    5.9 Linearization
        - linearization is generally achieved by placing a non-linear element
          in the feedback loop of the op amp

        Vin / R + I(Vout) = 0
            Vin = input voltage
            R = input resistance
            I(Vout) = nonlinear variation of current with voltage


        - If we then solve for Vout we get
            Vout = G(Vin  / R)
                - where G(Vin  / R) is a nonlinear function of the input
                  voltage
                    - usually inverse of I(Vout)


        - If we place a diode in the feedback, the function I(Vout) is exponential

            I(Vout) = Io * exp(alpha * Vout)
                Io = amplitude constant
                alpha = exponential constant

        [ figure 2.16 ]


        - the inverse of this exponential function is a logarithm, thus
            Vout = 1 / alpha * log_base_c(Vin) - 1 / alpha * log_base_c(Io * R)
