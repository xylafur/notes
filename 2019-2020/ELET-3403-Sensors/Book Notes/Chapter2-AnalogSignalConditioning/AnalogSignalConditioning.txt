1 - Introduction
    - signal conditioning is the operations performed on signals in order to
      get them into a suitable state for interfacing with other elements

    - We are interested only analog conversions, that is where the output is
      still analog

2 - Principles of Analog Signal Conditioning
    - Signal Conditioning is often refered to as a transfer function

    2.1 Signal Level Bias Changes
        - The most common signal conditioning modifies these features of a
          voltage representing a process variable

            - Adjusting the level
                - magnitude
            - Bias
                - zero value
                - change the 'y-intercept' so to speak

        - For instance we may need to transfer values from the range (0.2V,
          0.6V) to (0V, 5V)
            - we first change the zero value by adding or subtracting
            - then we multiply the range to equal the other
                - this can either be amplification or attenuation (making the
                  signal smaller value)

    2.2 Linearization
        - When devices are 'nearly linear' this can cause alot of problems

        - nowadays a signal is made linear using software

    2.3 Conversions
        - Many sensors exhibit changes of resistance with changes in a dynamic
          variable
            - In these cases, a circuit must be built to convert the change in
              resistance to either voltage or current

            - this is usually done using bridges

        - Signal Transmission
            - Since we generally use 4-20 mA as standard signal, we have to
              convert to current at transmistting end and to voltage at the
              receiving end

            - Current is used because it is independent of load

        - Digital Interface
            - ADCs often convert from analog to digital

            - sometimes you have to add some gain to the signal before feeding
              it into a ADC
                - the ADC may expect a much different range than the actual
                  value you are trying to measure


    2.4 Filtering and Impedance Matching
        - often interfearance signal of considerable strength are present in
          industrial enviornments

        - it is necessary to use high-pass, low-pass or notch filters to
          eliminate unwanted signals

        - there are two filter type
            - passive
                - uses resistors, capacitors and inductors

            - active
                - use gain and feedback

        - Impeadance Matching
            - important when transducer internal impeadance or line impeadance
              can cause errors in measurment of dynamic variable

    2.5 Concept of Loading
        - loading one circuit by another can cause significant problems
            - introduces uncertainty in the amplitude of the voltage

        - The load can be reduced into a Thevenin equivalent circuit
            [ Figure 2.1 ]
            [ Figure 2.2 ]

        


3 Passive Circuits
    - Bridge Circuits
        - Used for measuring changes in impeadance
            - especially when the changes are very small

    - Filter
        - a resistor and capacitor can be used to filter out noise

    - Divider Circuits

    3.1 Divider Circuits
        - can convert resistance variation into voltage variation


            Vd = (R2 * Vs) / (R1 + R2)

        - Issues with voltage dividers
            1. Vd does not vary linearly even if the resistance does!
            2. the total output impeadance (R2 || R2) may not be high, so
               loading effects must be considered

            3. Current will flow through both resistors
                - Power will be dissipated by both!
                - You must consider the power rating for both


    3.2 Bridge Circuits
        - Covert impeadance variations into voltage variations
