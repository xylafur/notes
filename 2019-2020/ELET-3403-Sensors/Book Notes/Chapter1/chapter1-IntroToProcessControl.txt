1.1 Introduction
    - Control: Force parameters in the enviornment. to have specific values

        - all of the elements necessary to accomplish the control objective are
          described by the term control system

1.2 Control Systems
    1.2.1 Process COntrol Principles
        - In process control, the basic objective is to regulate the value of
          some quantity

        - to regulate means to maintain that quantity at some desired value,
          regardless of external influences
            - the desired value is called the reference value or setpoint

        - The Process
            - Self Regulation
                - for some input, the state of the system will change until it
                  reaches a steady state and the output will become constant

                - if the input is changed then this will not be true

                - The example used in the book is a tank of water that has an
                  input rate and an output rate.  The output rate is directly
                  proportional to the amount of water in the tank.  At some
                  point the water will get high enough such that the input and
                  output rates will be the same

            - If you want something that can handle a different input value,
              then you need something more than self-regulation

            - Human Aided Control
                - If a human can see into the tank, and has an aparatus to
                  control the height of the water, then we can maintain a
                  constant height

                - The output flow is called the manipulated variable or
                  controlling variable

            - Automatic Control
                - machines, electronics or computers replace the operations of
                  the human

                - a sensor is added that is able to measure the value of the
                  level and convert it into a proportional signal s
                    - s is provided as the input to a machine, electric cicruit
                      or computer called the "controller"

                - The controller performs the function of the human evaluating
                  the measurement and providing the output signal, u, to change
                  the value of the output via an "actuator"


    1.2.2 Servomechanisms
        - THe objective of a Servomechanism is to force some parameter to vary
          in a specific manner
            - this may be valled a tracking control system

        - The controlled variable is forced to follow a variation of the
          reference value


    1.2.3 Discrete-State Control Systems
        - a type of control system that controls a sequence of events rather
          than regulation or variation of individual variables

        - Some task may have many variables that need to be kept track of

        - There is also a sequence of events that must occur

        - THe sequence is described in terms of events that are timed to be
          started and stopped at a specific schedule

        - THe starting and stopping of events is a discrete based system
          because the event is either true of false (started or stopped, open
          or closed, on or off)

        - this type of control system can be made automatic and is perfect for
          computer-based controllers

1.3 Process Control Block Diagram
    1.3.1 Identification of Elements
        - Process
            - Complex assembly of phenomena that relate to some manufacturing
              sequence
            - there may be many variables in a processz
            - there are single variable processes and multiariable processes
                - this referes to how many different variables need to be
                  controlled


        - Measurement
            - We measure a variable to have an idea of how we should regulate
              it

                - a sensor is a device that performs the initial measurement
                  and energy transformation into digital, electrical or
                  pnematic information

                - signal conditioning may also be required

            - A sensor is also called a transducer
                - transducer is just a device that converts any signal from one
                  form to another

                - all sensors are transducers, but not all transducers are
                  sensors


        - Error Detector
            - has magnitude and polarity

            - I think this is how far we are off form the goal, not what the
              sensor says vs what it really is

            - error determination must be made before any control action is
              taken


        - Controller
            - Examine the error and determine the action that should be taken

            - This has many names like compensator or filter, but controller is
              most common


        - Control Element
            - The device that exerts a direct influence on the process,
              provides the required changes in the controlled variable

            - There is often an intermediate operation in between the control
              element and the output, this is the actuator

                - an actuator translates the small energy signal of the
                  controller into a larger energy action


    - 1.3.2 Block Diagram
        - Controlled Variable of the process is denoted "c"

        - The measured representation of the controlled variable is "b"

        - The controlled variable setpoint is labeled "r"

        - The output signal is "p"
            - this is the input to the control element

        - The controlling process variable is "u"
            - this is how the control element operates, it modifies this value


        - The error detector does "e = r - b"


        - See figure 1.5 for the diagram


        - The Loop
            - The process control loop.
                - it is a feedback loop

            - How everything ties together, in a loop format
            - every element in the block diagram feeds into the next guy


            - With the loop, we aim to regulate some process variable
                - we ask, how well are we doing this?
                    - Not an easy question to answer

            - Error is used to determine the performance of a control system
                `e(t) = r - c(t)`

1.4 Control System Evaluation
    - The error is what is used to measure performance of the control system
        - the error varies in time

    - Control System Objective
        - The objective of a control system is to make the error equation
          zero


        - There are 3 primary requirements of a control system
            1. The system should be stable
            2. The system should provide the best possible steady state
               regulation
            3. The sytsem should provide the best possible transient
               regulation


    1.4.1 Stability
        - The more tightly the variable is controlled, the greater possibility
          of instability

    1.4.2 Steady State Regulation
        - the objective of Steady State Regulation is that the steady state
          error should be minimum

        - There is generally some allowable deviation around the setpoint
          (delta c)

    1.4.3 Transient Regulation
        - Transient regulation specifies how the control system reacts to bring
          the controlled variable to a new setpoint

        - Other process variables might influence the control variable and
          change very quickly.
            - the control system aims to minimize this effect, valled the
              transient response

    1.4.4 Evaluation Criteria
        - How well a control system is acting can be answered by
            1. Ensuring stability
            2. Evaluating Steady State Response
            3. Evaluating the reponse to setpoint changes and transient effects


        - The Term `Tuning` is used to indicate how a process control loop is
          adjusted to provide the best control


        - Damped Response
            - This is like an asymptote, where it just approaches the set point
              gradually and doesn't overshoot
                - the error is always either positive or netagive


            - quality
                - duration of the excursion
                    - usually defined as the time taken for the controlled
                      variable to go from 10% to 90% of the set value
                - the maximum error


                - these values are effected by the tuning!


        - Cyclic Response
            - the controlled variable oscillates about the setpoint but
              asymptotically approaches the setpoint

            - parameters of interest
                - max error
                - duration (esettling time)
                    - time when the allowable error is first exceeded to the
                      time when it falls wihin the allowable error

            - standard cyclic tuning criteria (some different tuning methods
              commonly used)
                - minimum area
                    - the area net area under the error time curve is a minimum

                    `A = integral( |e(t)| dt) = minimum`

                - quarter amplitude
                    - The aplitude of each next peak must be only a quarter of
                      the previous peak




1.5 Analog and Digital Processing
    - analog used to be used
        - data was processed as voltages of differing amplitude

    - nowadays everything is pretty much digital


    1.5.1 Data Representation
        - how the magnitude of some physical variable is represented in the
          control loop

        - Analog Data
            - There is a smooth and continuous variation between a
              representation of a variable value and the value itself

            - if the real value changes by some small amount, the measured
              value will also change by some small amount

        - Digital Data
            - numbers are represented in terms of bits

                - because of this we have limited resolution!

            - if the real value changes by less than the resolution, this will
              not be reflected in the measured value


        - Data Conversions
            - ADCs convert analog to digital
            - DACs do the opposite

    1.5.2 On/Off Control
        - This is a very old, very crude and simple, digiral processing
            - has been used long before computers were around

        - The final control element only has two states
            - thus the controller output need have only these two states



        `Ve = K(Vref - V)`
            - this is the error voltage
            - Vref is the reference


        - Deadband
            - range in recorded values where no action will occur

        - Hysteresis
            - the behavior of the system is different at the same recoreded value
                - depending on if the value is increasing or devreasing


    1.5.3 Analog Control
        - Exists when all variable in the system are analog representations of
          another variable


    1.5.4 Digital Control
        - There are two approaches to using computes for control

        - Supervisory Control
            - when computers were first being used, they suffered from
              reliability problems

            - A single computer monitors many control loops and uses software
              to optimize the setpoints for the best overal plant operation

            - if the computer fails, analog backup sytsems keep the process
              running at the last setpoints

            - TLDR:
                A computer sets the Vref Value.
                If the computer fails, the Vref value is still set and the
                system keeps operating


        - Direct Digital Control:
            - the analog processing loop is discarded

            - input feeds intp a ADC that feeds into computer

            - output from the computer feeds into a DAC which feeds into the
              system

                ->Thing -> Sensor -> ADC -> Computer -> DAC -> Thing --
               /                                                        \
               |________________________________________________________|


            - Smart Sensor
                - direct integration of microprocessor based controller
                  computer directly into sensors
                    - signal conditioning
                    - ADC
                    - computer controller

                    - all in the sensor housing



            - Networked Control Systems
                - All of the smart sensors are placed on LAN

                - there are standards that try to allow for plug and play
                  behavior

    - 1.5.5 Programmable Logic Controllers
        - Basically a bunch of switches you program to open and close based on
          particular input



1.6 Units, Standards and Definitions
    1.6.1 Units
        - 

    1.6.2 Analog Data Representation
        - For whatever is being measured, a range over that thing must be
          specified

        - Current Signal
            - Current is used instead of voltage because the system is then
              less dependent on load
                - if the resistance of the line changes, then so will the
                  voltage
                - current is not suseptible to resistance changes in this way

        - Pneumatic Signals
            - generally 3-15 psi


    1.6.3 Definitions
        - Error:
            - used to describe the results of a measurement
            - difference between the actual value and the measured value
                - the actual value is the set value, the desired value

        - Block Definitions;
            - Has an input variable x(t) and an output variable y(t)

        - Transfer Function
            - T(x, y, t)
                - describes the relationship between the input and output for
                  the block

            - Two Parts
                - Static Part
                    - describes the input/output relationship when the input is
                      not changing in time
                - Dynamic Part
                    - describes the input/output relationship when there is
                      time variation on the input


            - Can be represented in many different ways, equations, table,
              graphs


        - Accuracy
            - the maximum overall error to be expected from a device

            - usually expressed as "inaccuracy"

            - forms
                1. Measured variable
                    - If there is uncertainty in what was measured

                2. Percentage of the instrument full-scale reading
                    - inaccuracy the full scale?

                3. Percentage of instrument span
                    - the percentage of the range of instruemnt measurement
                      capability

                4. Percentage of the actual reading


            - For digital systems we are most worried with the digital
              representation of analog values and the accuracy of this

                - A/D converter will be specified as volts per bit +- some
                  threshold

        - System Accuracy
            - the overall accuracy of many elements in a process-control loop

            - Express the accuracy of each element in terms of the transfer
              functions


            - BAsically you have the product of the transfer functions and
              their uncertainties multiplied by the dynamic variable

                V +- ^V = (K +- ^K)(G +- ^G)C
                    V   : output voltage
                    K, G: nominal transfer functions
                    C   : Dynamic variable


            - Statistics tells us that it is best to use the root mean square
              for overall uncertainty

                [^V/V]rms = +- sqrt((^K/K)^2 + (^G/G)^2)



        - Sensitivity
            - Measure of the change in output of an instrument for a change in
              input

            - generally high sensitivity is desirable

            - Other evaluation parameters:
                - linearity or output to input
                - range
                - accuracy

            - The value of sensitivity is generally given by the transfer
              function


        - Hysteresis and Reproducibility
            - Often an instrument does not have the se output for the same
              input given repeated trials

                - This is due to inherent uncertainties that imply a limit on
                  the reproducibility of the device

            - hysteresis
                - get different readings for inputs depending on if you came
                  from above or below


                - generally specified as a percentage of full scale maximum
                  deviation between two curves

        - Resolution
            - minimum measurable value for a particular device

            - in digital it is determined by how much 1 bit represents, in
              analog it is determined by the minimal measurable value

        - Linearity
            - linear relationship between input and output is highly desirable


            - one output specification of sensor output is the degree to which
              it is linear with the measured variable and the span over which
              it occurs
                - a common specification of linearity is the maximum deviation
                  from a strainght line

            - for example if a sensor outputs voltage as a function of pressure
              from 0 to 100 psi with linearity of 5% FS. 
                - at some point on the curve of voltage vs pressure, the
                  deviation between actual pressure and linearly indicated
                  pressure for a given voltage deviates by 5%

    1.6.4 Process-Control Drawings
        - Essential Elemenets
            - The P&ID Diagram depicts the entire plant and associated control
              systems
            
                - there are symbols for  flow lines, computers, PLCs, sensors,
                  etc..


            - Cascade Control System
                - the setpoint of one loop is the controller output of another
                  loop

        - Instrument Lines Symbols
            - 4 to 20mA current signal
                - represented using a dashed line

            - pneumatic signal
                - line with cross hatches

            - digital feed into computer
                - solid line with bubbles

        - Other Symbols
            - control valves are often labeled by what they control

1.7 Sensor Time Response
    - static transfer function of a process-control loop
        - specifies how the output is related to the input if the input is
          constant

        - there is a lag between when the measured value changes and the output
          of the sensor changes to this value

    - dynamic transfer function
        - time dependence of an element

        - specifies how the output changes in time when the input is changing
          in time

        - independent from the static transfer function

        - often called time response

        - important for sensors because they are the primary element for
          providing knowledge of the controlled variable

    

    1.7.1 First-Order Response
        - first order because for all sensors of this type, the time response
          if determined by the solution of a first-order difeq

        b(t) = bi + (bf - bi)[1 - e ^ (-t / T)]

        - the sensor is in error as it transitions from bi to bf

        - Time Constant
            - represents the time at which the output value has changed by ~
              63% of the total change

            - the output has reached ~ the actual value after 5 time constants

        - the output of the sensor must vary linearly with the input!

        - Real Time Effects
            - exponential time response and time constant is based on the
              assumption that there is a sudden discontinuous change in the
              input value
                - this isn't reality


    1.7.2 Second Order Response
        - in some sensors, a step change int he input causes the output to
          oscillate for a short period of time before settling to the value
          that coresponds to the new value

        - described by a second order diffeq

        - not possible to make a universal solution
            - we can describe the general nature of the response

        R(t) is proportional to R0 * e ^ (-a * t) * sin(2 * pi * fn * t)

            R(t): the transducer output
            a   : output damping constant
            fn  : natural frequency of the oscillation
            R0  : amplitude

        - Such a transducer can be said to track the input when the input
          changes in a time that is greater than the period represented by the
          natural frequency

        - The damping constant defines the time one must wait for the
          transducer output to be a true indication of the transducer input


1.8 Significance and Statistics
    - we will look at another feature of measurment that may be misleading
      about the actual value of a variable

    - We also look at a method to help interpret the significance of
      measurements


    1.8.1 Significant Figures
        - significant figures are important!
        - You can't gain any significant figures, you can only have as much
          significance as you start with

        - Significance in Measurement
            - significance is limited by
                analog: readability
                digital: number of digits

            - not the same as accuracy!!

        - Significance in Calculations
            - can't obtain a measurement with more significance thant the
              numbers employed in the calculation

        - Significance in Design
            - Use the sigfigs specified in the design sheet

    1.8.2 Statistics
        - we can determine the confidence in the value of a variable

        - for instance you may want to take measurements in 10 locations and
          calculate the average of those for consideration

        - Standard Deviation
            - Tells you how spread out the values in the set are from the
              average
