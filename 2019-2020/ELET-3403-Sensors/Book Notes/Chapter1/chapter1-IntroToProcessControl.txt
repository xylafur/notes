1.1 Introduction
    - Control: Force parameters in the enviornment. to have specific values

        - all of the elements necessary to accomplish the control objective are
          described by the term control system

1.2 Control Systems
    1.2.1 Process COntrol Principles
        - In process control, the basic objective is to regulate the value of
          some quantity

        - to regulate means to maintain that quantity at some desired value,
          regardless of external influences
            - the desired value is called the reference value or setpoint

        - The Process
            - Self Regulation
                - for some input, the state of the system will change until it
                  reaches a steady state and the output will become constant

                - if the input is changed then this will not be true

                - The example used in the book is a tank of water that has an
                  input rate and an output rate.  The output rate is directly
                  proportional to the amount of water in the tank.  At some
                  point the water will get high enough such that the input and
                  output rates will be the same

            - If you want something that can handle a different input value,
              then you need something more than self-regulation

            - Human Aided Control
                - If a human can see into the tank, and has an aparatus to
                  control the height of the water, then we can maintain a
                  constant height

                - The output flow is called the manipulated variable or
                  controlling variable

            - Automatic Control
                - machines, electronics or computers replace the operations of
                  the human

                - a sensor is added that is able to measure the value of the
                  level and convert it into a proportional signal s
                    - s is provided as the input to a machine, electric cicruit
                      or computer called the "controller"

                - The controller performs the function of the human evaluating
                  the measurement and providing the output signal, u, to change
                  the value of the output via an "actuator"


    1.2.2 Servomechanisms
        - THe objective of a Servomechanism is to force some parameter to vary
          in a specific manner
            - this may be valled a tracking control system

        - The controlled variable is forced to follow a variation of the
          reference value


    1.2.3 Discrete-State Control Systems
        - a type of control system that controls a sequence of events rather
          than regulation or variation of individual variables

        - Some task may have many variables that need to be kept track of

        - There is also a sequence of events that must occur

        - THe sequence is described in terms of events that are timed to be
          started and stopped at a specific schedule

        - THe starting and stopping of events is a discrete based system
          because the event is either true of false (started or stopped, open
          or closed, on or off)

        - this type of control system can be made automatic and is perfect for
          computer-based controllers

1.3 Process Control Block Diagram
    1.3.1 Identification of Elements
        - Process
            - Complex assembly of phenomena that relate to some manufacturing
              sequence
            - there may be many variables in a processz
            - there are single variable processes and multiariable processes
                - this referes to how many different variables need to be
                  controlled


        - Measurement
            - We measure a variable to have an idea of how we should regulate
              it

                - a sensor is a device that performs the initial measurement
                  and energy transformation into digital, electrical or
                  pnematic information

                - signal conditioning may also be required

            - A sensor is also called a transducer
                - transducer is just a device that converts any signal from one
                  form to another

                - all sensors are transducers, but not all transducers are
                  sensors


        - Error Detector
            - has magnitude and polarity

            - I think this is how far we are off form the goal, not what the
              sensor says vs what it really is

            - error determination must be made before any control action is
              taken


        - Controller
            - Examine the error and determine the action that should be taken

            - This has many names like compensator or filter, but controller is
              most common


        - Control Element
            - The device that exerts a direct influence on the process,
              provides the required changes in the controlled variable

            - There is often an intermediate operation in between the control
              element and the output, this is the actuator

                - an actuator translates the small energy signal of the
                  controller into a larger energy action


    - 1.3.2 Block Diagram
        - Controlled Variable of the process is denoted "c"

        - The measured representation of the controlled variable is "b"

        - The controlled variable setpoint is labeled "r"

        - The output signal is "p"
            - this is the input to the control element

        - The controlling process variable is "u"
            - this is how the control element operates, it modifies this value


        - The error detector does "e = r - b"


        - See figure 1.5 for the diagram


        - The Loop
            - The process control loop.
                - it is a feedback loop

            - How everything ties together, in a loop format
            - every element in the block diagram feeds into the next guy


            - With the loop, we aim to regulate some process variable
                - we ask, how well are we doing this?
                    - Not an easy question to answer

            - Error is used to determine the performance of a control system
                `e(t) = r - c(t)`

1.4 Control System Evaluation
    - The error is what is used to measure performance of the control system
        - the error varies in time

    - Control System Objective
        - The objective of a control system is to make the error equation
          zero


        - There are 3 primary requirements of a control system
            1. The system should be stable
            2. The system should provide the best possible steady state
               regulation
            3. The sytsem should provide the best possible transient
               regulation


    1.4.1 Stability
        - The more tightly the variable is controlled, the greater possibility
          of instability

    1.4.2 Steady State Regulation
        - the objective of Steady State Regulation is that the steady state
          error should be minimum

        - There is generally some allowable deviation around the setpoint
          (delta c)

    1.4.3 Transient Regulation
        - Transient regulation specifies how the control system reacts to bring
          the controlled variable to a new setpoint

        - Other process variables might influence the control variable and
          change very quickly.
            - the control system aims to minimize this effect, valled the
              transient response

    1.4.4 Evaluation Criteria
        - How well a control system is acting can be answered by
            1. Ensuring stability
            2. Evaluating Steady State Response
            3. Evaluating the reponse to setpoint changes and transient effects


        - The Term `Tuning` is used to indicate how a process control loop is
          adjusted to provide the best control


        - Damped Response
            -
