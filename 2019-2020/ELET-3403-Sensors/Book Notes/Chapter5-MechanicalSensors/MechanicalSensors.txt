2. Displacement, Location or Position Sensors
    2.1 Potentiometric Sensors
        - Converts linear or angular motion into a changing resistance
            - A potentiometric displacement sencor is pretty simple.
                - just a wound resistor and a wiper.  Moving the wiper causes motion against the
                  resistor, leading to a different output resistance

            [ figure 5.1 ]

    2.2 Capcaitive and Inductive Sensors
        - displacement causes changes in capacity or inductance

        - Capactitive
            - using the capitance equation, we can figure out how the sensor works
                - C = K * Eo * A / d

            - Three cays to change capacity
                - Distance between plates
                - Shared Area of Plates
                - Dielectric Constant

        - Inductance
            - a core is inserted into an inductor
                - this produces a new inductance value
            - as the core moves through the inductor, the inductance value changes




    2.3 Variable-Reluctance Sensors
        - Moving a core produces a varying magnetic flux coupling between two or more coils

        - applications to measure both translational and angular displacement

        - Linear Variable Differential Transformer (LVDT)

            [ figure 5.2 ]

            - most common Variable Reluctance Sensors
            - 3 coils of wire wound on a hollow form

            - core of a permiable material can slide freely through the center of the form
                - the inner coil is the primary
                    - it is excied by some AC source
                    - flux is formed and linked to two secondary coils

                - an ac voltage is then induced in the two secondary coils

                [ figure 5.3 ]

                - you can determine the direction of motion by the ac in the secondary coils
                    - voltage amplitude and phase change can determine the direction and extent of
                      core motion

                [ figure 5.4 ]

    2.4 Level Sensors
        - There are a variety of techniques

        - Mechanical
            - a floater allowed to ride up and down with level changes

            [ figure 5.5 ]

        - electrical
            - You can use the inheret conductivity of a liquid or solid to vary resistance through
              probles in the material

            - You can also use two cylendars
                - the cylinders act as capacitors, the dielectric constant changes depending on the
                  level of liquid / air over different components

                [ figure 5.6 ]


        - Untrasonic
            - you don't have to actually place anything in the material, you use ultrasonic
              reflection to measure

            [ figure 5.7 ]

        - Pressure
            - non contact measurement based on density of liquid

            - you can use the desnity of liquid and pressure at bottom of the tank to determine the
              height


3 Strain Sensors
    - usually used as a secondary step in sensors to measure other process variables, such as:
        - flow
        - pressure
        - weight
        - acceleration

    3.1 Stress and Stran
        - Forces
            - defined in a special way described by the general term stress

        - Strain
            - resulting deformation in a solid from stress
            - the result of the application of forces to solid objects

        - Stress
            - Force per unit of area

            - tensile Stress/Strain
                - F / A

                [ figure 5.8 ]

                - strain for tensile stress is defined as the fractional change in length
                    delta(l) / l

                    - unitless

            - compressional Stress/Strain
                - The only difference between this and tenisile stress/strain is the polarity of
                  the change in length

            - Shear Stress/Strain
                - the force is applied as a couple (not along the same line)

                [ figure 5.9 (a) ]

                - strain is thus
                    - fractional change in dimension of the sheared member

                    [ figure 5.9 (b) ]


            - Stress-Strain Curve
                - relationship between sress and strain is linear over some range of stress
                    - if the stress is kept within this range, the material is called "elastic"

                - If the elastic limit is exceeded, permenent deformation of the material occurs

                - linearity and slope are a constant of the type of material only

                - the constant of linearity / slope is called the "modulus of elasticity" or
                  "Young's Modulus"
                    - the unit is N/m^2

                - For tensile and compressional stress
                    E = stress / strain = (F/A) / (delta(l) / l)

                - For Shear stress
                    M = stress / strain = (F/A) / (delta(x) / l)

            - Strain Nits
                - though strain is unitless, it is common to express strain as the ratio of two
                  length units (cm/cm or in/in)

                

    3.2 Strain Gauge Principles
        - Reminder: Resistance of a metal is given by
            Ro = p * (lo / Ao)

        - Under tensile or compressional stress, the length / area of a metal will change
            - the volume must remain the same though

                V = lo * Ao = (lo + delta(l) * (Ao - delta(A))

            - Because of thie, the resistance will have changed
                R = p * (lo + delta(l)) / (Ao - delta(A)) ~= 2 * Ro * delta(l) / lo

            - we see that the ratio of change in length over length can be directly converted into
              a resistance

            - The change in resistance is very small though, so the measurement methods must be
              highly sophisticated

        - Measurement Principles
            - attach a metal wire or foil to the element whose strain is to be measured


        - Temperature Effects
            - change temperature can really fuck shit up, a change of 1 degree C can alter the
              resistance of the metal we are trying to measure strain for by alot more than the
              change in length does

    3.3 Metal Strain Guages
        - important terms for understanding strain guage applications

        - Gague factor
            - relation between strain and resistance change is only approximately true
                - impurities in the metal or other lurking factors can muck stuff up

            - an SG giceves relationship through the "gague factor"
                GF = (delta(R) / R) / strain

                - the higher the GF the better
                    - larger change in resistance for a given strain

        - Construction
            - use in two forms: wire and foil

        - Signal Conditioning
            - two important effects critical for signal conditioning
                - fractional changes in resistance require special resistance measurement circuits
                - compensation for temperature change

            - the bridge circuit is the answer to both of these
                - one arm bridge
                    - a dummy gague is used to that we know the resistance of the sensor at
                      the current temperature without any stress applied

                        - the dummy gauge is in one arm of the bridge



                    [ figure 5.10 ]

                - two arm bridge
                    - uses active strain gagues in two arms of the bridge
                    - the resistors in all 4 arms are strain gagues
                        - two are for temperature compensation only

                    delta(V) = (Vs / 2) * GF * (delta(l) / l)

                    - one of the active gagues experiences compression while the other one is
                      stretched

                    [ figure 5.11 ]

                    [ figure 5.12 ]


    3.4 Semiconductor Strain Gagues
        - principles
            - resistivity and physical dimensions changes with strain
                - because of changes in electron hole mobility

            - results in a much larger gauge factor

        - gague factor
            GF = (delta(R)/R) / strain

            - often a negative value for semiconductor
                - resistances decreases with stress

            - These are highly non-linear devices


        - signal conditioning
            - still typicalls a bridge circuit with temperature compensation

    3.5 Load Cells
        - transducer device which measures deformations



4 Motion Sensors
    - measure the rate of change of position, location or displacement of an object

    - an accelerometer can be used to obtain velocity and position as well
        - through integration



    4.1 Types of Motion
        - a device is often tailored to the type of motion

        - Rectilinear
            - motion characterized by velocity and acceleration
            - maximum accelerations are less than a few gs
            - not suited for curved motion, specific for straight line motion

            - if you need more than one direction you need more than one of these sensors

        - Angular
            - measure only rotations on some axis
            - can't be used for displacement, only rotation along some axis

        - Vibration
            - Object placed in periodic motion which experiences large peak acceleration
            - position is given by
                x(t) = xp * sin(wt)

                - xp is the peak displacement

            - get the velocity through the direvative of the position, acceleration from dir of
              that, etc

        - Shock
            - occurs when an object in uniform motion suddenly stops
            - deacceleration that occurs within a very short time

    4.2 Accelerometer Principles
        - Spring Mass System
            - Hook's Law
                F = k * delta(x)

            - Test Mass / Seismic Mass
                - mass that converts acceleration to spring displacement

        - Natural Frequency and Damping
            - a spring mass system always exhibits some natural frequency

                fn = (1 / (2*pi)) * sqrt(k/m)

            - friction is the only thing which brings the system back to rest
                - the friction is defined by a damping coefficient (alpha)
                - oscillation is called transient response

                X(t) = Xo * e^(- alpha * t) * sin(2 * pi * fn * t)

        - Vibration Effects
            - if the spring mass system is exposed to a vibration, the resultant acceleration is
              given by

                a(t) = - w^2 * xo * sin(wt)

            - the displacement is given by
                delta(x) = - (m*xo) / k * w^2 * sin(wt)

    4.3 Types of Accelerometers
        - we use different accelerometers dependent on the applications
            - range, natural frequency and damping determine the accelerometer


        - potentiometric
            - simplest accelerometer type measures motion by attachin spring mass to the wiper arm
              of a potentiometer

        - LVDT
            - core through a coil

            - displacements of the core are converted into a linearly propotional AC voltage

        - Variable Reluctance
            - same category of LVDT, inductive principle is employed
            - mass is usually a permanent magnet

        - Piezoelectric
            - with come crystals, a voltage is generated across the crystal when the crystal is
              stressed

            - crystal is attached to a mass attached to spring
                - a force on the whole thing will squeeze the crystal more or less and produce a
                  different voltage

                [ figure 5.13 ]

    4.4 Applications
        - Steady State Acceleration
            - measuring acceleration that varies but is non periodic
                - an automobile motion is an example

            - we need to select a sensor such that
                1. Adequate range to cover magnitudes
                2. Natural frequency of the sensor must have a period shorter than the time span
                   over which the acceleration is measured

            - Electronic integrators can be used to aquire both velocity and position

        - Vibration
            - aplied frequency of the vibration must be less than the frequency of the accelerometr
            - the range of the acceleration must never exceed the specification of the device

        - Shock
            - device mmust have a natural frequency greater than 1kHz and rage > 500g
        - Shock



5. Pressure Sensors
    - Pressure is often converted into some immediate form, such as displacement, thdn a sensor
      uses that to measure the pressure

    5.1 Pressure Principles
        - Pressure if force per unit area that a fluid exerts on its surroundings

        - for a gas the pressure is uniform all along the vessel, but for a liquid it is greatest
          at the bottom of the container

        - Static Pressure
            - pressure where no motion is occuring

        - Dynamic Pressure
            - if the fluid is motion, then the pressure exerted depends on the motion

            - pressure can depend on flow, compressibility of fluid, external forces and other
              factors

        - Units
            - SI units is Newtons per square meter with is called a "Pascal"

            - pound per square inch (psi) is the customary scale
            

        - Gauge Pressure
            - pressure that subtracts the atmosperic pressure

                p_g = p_abs - p_at

        - Head Pressure
            - used to describe the pressure of a liquid in a tank or pipe
            - static pressure produced by the weight of the liquid above the point at which the
              pressure is being described

            - the pressure depends only on the height of the liquid

                p = (density) * g * h


    5.2 Pressure Sensors (p>1 atmosphere)
        - Diaphram
            - a think flexible piece of metal
            - can tell you the difference between pressure on the two sides based on the way the
              piece of metal in between bends and by how much


            [ figure 5.14]

            F = (p2 - p1) * A

        - Bellows
            - similar to Diaphram but the displacement is much more straight line

            - you have a pressure activated lever sort of thing that pushes the core of a LVDT
                - an LVDT is used because the conversion from pressure to displacement is nearly
                  linear

            [ figure 5.15 ]

        - Bourdon Tube
            - most common pressure sensor

            - have a metal tube thats flattened slightly with one end closed
                - the tube is then also curved or even spiraled

                - the tube will straighten out if the inside pressure is higher than the outside
                  pressure
                - the tube will curve more if the pressure is lower outside than inside


        - Electronic Conversions
            - techniquest for converting displacements from prvious examples into electronic
              signals

                - simplest is to just have a metal linkage connected to a potentiometer

                - in some cases the strain is just directly converted into a diaprham or something

                - there is a feedback mechanism to limit the actual deflection of the diaphram

                [ figure 5.16 ]

        - Solid State Pressure Sensors
            - Small units with only 3 connections that come in a small IC package
            - generally uited for 0 to 100 kPa


            [ figure 5.17 ]


    5.3 Pressure Sensors (p < 1 atmosphere)
        - made using purely electronic methods

        - For use less than 1 atm down to 10^(-3) atm
            - These operate by measuring heat loss over a given distance
                - this will tell you the number of gas molecles per unit volume


            - Pirani Gague
                - determines filament temp through a measure of filament resistance
                - filament exitation and resistance measurement are both done using bridge circuit
                - highly non-linear

            - Thermocouple
                - measures filament temperature using a thermocouple connected directly to heating
                  filament
                - highly non linear


            - for both of these the calibration of the sensor needs to be done relative to the
              paritcular gas

        - Ionization Gague
            - useful for very low pressures, (10^-3) atm to 10^(-13) atm

            - uses electrons from the heated filament to ionize the gas whose pressure is to be
              monitored

                - then the current flowing between two electrons in the ionized enviornment is
                  measured

            [ figure 5.18 ]


6. Flow Sensors
    - measurement and control of flow are very important for process industries
        - flow of raw materials, or waste flow are all considered


    - in this chapter we wlil cover the flow of materials in all 3 states of  matter and common
      principles used for measuring this flow


    6.1 Solid Flow Measurement
        - usually for small particles such as powder

        - if the powerder is mixed with a liquid host, the thing is called a slurry
            - slurry is considered in the liquid flow section

        - Conveyor Flow Concepts
            - for solid objects flow is usually described by mass / weight per unit time

            - you need to measure the weight / mass of material over some fixed length of the
              conveyer system

            [ figure 5.19 ]

            Q = (WR) / L

            - weight is measured with a load cell, something like an LVDT

    6.2 Liquid Flow
        - only the basics of liquid flow are covered in this chapter 

        - Flow Units
            1. Volume Flow Rate
                - expressed as a volume delivered per unit time

            2. Flow Velocity
                - distance the liquid travels in the varrier per unit of time
                - usually given as something like m/min or ft/min

                V = (Q/A)
                    - V = Flow Velocity
                    - Q = Volume Flow Rate
                    - A = Cross sectional Area of flow carrier

            3. Mass or Weight Flow Rate
                - Mass or weight per unit of time

                F = pQ
                    - F = mass / weight flow rate
                    - p = mass / weight density
                    - Q = Volume Flow rate



        - Pipe Flow Principles
            - flow rate through a pipe is determined primarilly by pressure forcing the liquid
              through the pipe

        - Restriction Flow Sensors
            - flow rate can be determined by pressure drop through a restricted pipe
            - when you force moving liquid through a narrow pipe, the pressure difference across
              the pipe will tell you the volume flow rate

            Q = K * sqrt(delta(p))

            [ figure  5.20 ]


            - there are three common types of restrictions
