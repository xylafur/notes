- ARM Cortex M3
    - Harvard Architecture
        - data and instructions have seperate buses

    - Registers
        - 3 general purpose registers
        - 2 stack pointers

        - a link register
        - a PC

        - a number of special registers including a program status register
            - status register
                - there are many of these

                - Applicatoin Program Status Register (APSR)

                - Interrupt Program Status Register (IPSR)

                - EPSR (EPSR)

                - Program status register (PSR)
                    - this holds things about the result of an operation (overflow /
                      negative and all of that)

    - Memory Map
        - Flash Rom
            - size (256k)

            - starts at 0x0000.0000
            - ends at   0x0003.FFFF

        - RAM
            - size (64k)

            - starts at 0x2000.0000
            - ends at   0x2000.FFFF

        - Bit banded alias of RAM
            - starts at 0x2200.0000
            - ends at   0x221F.FFFF

        - Bit Banded alias of IO Ports
            - starts at 0x4200.0000
            - ends at   0x43FF.FFFF

        - I/O sppace
            - Begins at 0x4000.0000
            - Ends at   0x5FFF.FFFF

        - Internal I/O'
            - Begins at 0xE000.0000
            - Ends at   0xE00F.FFFF
