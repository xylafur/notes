TODO:
    For the assignment add that a looser framework like agile would allow for the
    requirements to change and the burden on the developers is minimal




- Software Engineering Principles
    - software engineering is just a framework of best practices
        - processes that are helped by tools and technologies that are avaliable to build
          effective software applications


    - guiding principles
        - be agile
            - be flexible to changes
            - allows for requirement changes

        - Focus on the quality of your code

        - the team must be effective
            - must be self organizing and have mutual trust and respect

        - You have to have effective communication to be an effective team

        - effectively manage change

    - communication principles
        - listen
        - prepare
        - stay focused
        - take notes on all important points
        - strive for collaboration

        - move on
            - once you argree on something, move on
            - if you can't agree on something, move on


    - Planning Principles
        - Understand the scope
            - only agree to things if you understand what you will be doing
            - you must know how much effort something is going to take before you start
              something

        - Involve the customer
            - they define the priorites and establish the constraints

        - Changes are inevitable

        - Estimate baseed on what you know
            - you have to know what you are being asked, if you have done this before,
              how long did it take?

            - have you considered testing?
            - have you considered bugs and design changes?
                - gotta consider that in your estimate


                - undercommiting and overdelivering is always great, not the other way
                  around

        - be realistic
            - what are you actually going to be able to finish?

        - Track and adjust everything as required
