- The four p's
    - people
    - product
    - process
    - project


- stakeholders
    - managers
    - customers
    - end users

- prolem decomposition
    - partitioning / problem elaboration
    - decompose the scope into a set of problem classes
    - decomposition continues until all functions or problem classes have been defined

- process metrics
    - measure quality
    - measure productivity
    - statistical analysis (defects reported)
    - defect removal efficiency
    - reusability

- Measures of quality
    - correctness
    - maintainabiliy
    - integreity
    - usability

- Estimation
    - has inherent risk
        - risk leads to uncertainty

    - steps
        - understand scope
        - elaboration is necessary (decomposition)
        - use historical metrics to help
        - use at least 2 different techniques
        - uncertainty is inherent in this process
