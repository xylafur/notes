- Software quality
    - an effective software process applied in a maner that creates a useful product
        - the value of the product has measurable value

    - high quality if
        - software follows requirements
        - has expected results
        - easy to use
        - error free
        - easy to maintain and extend

    - dimensions of quality
        - performance
        - feature
        - reliability
        - conformance
        - durability

- Review
    - a meeting by technical people for technical people
    - technical assessment of a work product created during the software engineering process

    - they are not
        - progress reports

    - Defects vs errors
        - error
            - quality problem found beffore the software is released to end users

        - defect
            - quality problem found after the software has been released to end users

- Regression Testing
    - re-execution of some subset of tests that have already passed


- Smoke testing
    - uncover "show stopper" errors
    - smoke testing should happen daily
