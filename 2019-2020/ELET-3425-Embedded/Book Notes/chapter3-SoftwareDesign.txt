3.1 Attitude
    - The easiest way to debug is to write software without any bugs


    - Its better to have some things working then a whole system full of bugs


3.2 Quality Programming

3.3 Software Style Guidelines
    3.3.1 Organization of a code file
        - these regions should occur in ever code file

            - opening comments
                - name of the file, copywrite status






3.6 Threads
    - software is a list of instructions for the computer to execute

    - A thread is the path of action of the software as it executes

    - Generally the main program is called the "Foregound thread"
        - it is a loop that never ends

    - Interrupts allow for us to create multiple threads
        - these threads can either be static, living throughout the life of the
          software, or dynamic, created and destroyed during the lifetime of the
          program

        - You can have any number of background threads!
            - though the processor can only process one thing at once
