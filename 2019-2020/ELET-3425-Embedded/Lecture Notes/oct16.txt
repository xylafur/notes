- Interrupt PINS

- Something we want to do today is:
    - count the number of rising edges

- Registers
    - GPIOIEV
        - Interrupt Event Register

        - set pin to 1 for rising edge
        - set pin to 0 for falling edge


    - GPIOIBE
        - Interrupt on both edges

        - set to 1 for both edges
        - set to 0 for not both


    - GPIOIS
        - interrupt sense

        - set to 0 for edge-sensitive
        - set to 1 for level-sensitive


    - GPIOIM
        - Interruipt mask

        - set to 0 for masked
        - set to 1 for not masked


    - GPIOICR
        - Interrupt clear

        - setting to 0 interrupt is uneffected
        - setting to 1 interrupt is cleared


    - GPIORIS
        - Raw Interrupt Status

        - READ ONLY REGISTER

        - status of interrupts prior to masking

    - NVIC PR
        - Priority register

        - NVIC_PRI{0..11}_R
            - each port / pin gets 3 bits


    - NVIC EN
        - Enable a particular interrupt in NVIC

        - NVIC_EN{0,1}_R


- TYPICAL INTERVIEW QUESTION
    - what is the difference between a hardware ack and a software ack

- NVIC
    - controlles interrupts on the cortex M3
    - to activate
        - arm
            - IM
        - enable
            - IBE, IS, IEV

        - set priority

        - enable that source in the NVIC
