- We are on the last chapter, talking about timers

- time interfacing
    - with timers we can do two things
        1. Capture Input
        2. Generate Interrupts
            - we can create periodic interrupts
            - generate an interrupt every hour or so

    - Input Capture
        - input edge time mode
        - we can see the amount of time between an interrupt is triggered, we can use this to time
          phenomena
            - we can measure the period or pulse width of digital signals

        - We can also use it to count the number of edges


    - Programmable Timers
        - we have 4 GPTM (general purpose timer module) timers
            - General purpose means that we can program it any way we want

            - timers 0, 1, 2 and 3

            - each of the GPTM
                - has 2 16 bit timers
                    - Timer A
                    - Timer B

                    (so we have Timer0A, Timer0B, etc...)

            - Configured to operate independently as
                - timers
                - event counters


- Input Capture (Input Edge Time Mode)
    - each module consists of
        - external input pin
            - CCPO

        - trigger flag
            - Raw interrupt status
            - CAERIS

        - two edge control bits, event bits
            - TAEVENT

            - can be used to pause / restart the timer

        - an arm bit
            - Interrupt Mask
            - CAEIM

        - a 16 bit input capture register
            - TAR

    - Interfacing
        - Set the alternate function of whichever pin to turn on the timer

        - Timer0
            - Timer0A - PB0/CCP0
            - Timer0B - PF6/CCP1
        - Timer1
            - Timer 1A - PB1/CCP2
            - Timer 1B - PG4/CCP3

    - Timer REsources in Sterllaris
        - GPTM

        - SysTick
            - special purpose

        - PWM
            - special purpose

    - Modes Supported
        - 32 bit timer mode
        - 16 bit timer mode
        - 16 bit input capture mode
        - 16 bit PWM mode

    - Input Capture (Input Edge Time Mode)
        - Actions form iput capture event
            - Rising or Falling Edge of CCP0

          |      |        |      |
        __|      |________|      |_
        FFFF     A123     0FFF
            
            half_period = clk_period * (0xA123 - 0x0FFF)


    - Pulse width is the time between the rising and falling edge
