- Arm Cortex M3
    - Initializing an IO Port

    - IO Programming
        - IO ports are memory mapped

        - using symbolic definitions
            - things are named in an obvious way, there is meaninf for the programmer

            GPIO_PORTD_DIR_R
                - gpio in port d, direction register

        - by default all pins are regular port pins (GPIO)
            - none of the alternative functions are activated

    - Initializing an IO port
        1. Activate the clock for the port
            - Use the SYSCTL_RCGC2_R register
            - set the mask for whichever ports that you want activated

        2. Set the direction register
            - use the GPIO_PORTx_DIR_R register for this port

            - there is a register for each port, and a bit for each of the pins in the
              port
                - 0 is input, 1 is output

        3. Clear bits in the alternate function register
            - make sure that the pin is set to GPIO mode

            - use the GPIO_PORTx_AFSEL_R register
                - Alternate Fuction Select Register

            - there is a sel bit for each of the pins in each of the ports
                - set them to 1 for the alternative functions, make it 0 for GPIO

        4. Enable the digital port
            - disable pins you aint using
            - enable the pin you need to use

            - Use the GPIO_PORTx_DEN_R
                - digital enable register


        - Then we can read or write with the GPIO_PORTx_DATA_R register
