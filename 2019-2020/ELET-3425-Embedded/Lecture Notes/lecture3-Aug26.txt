- Introduction to Embedded Systems
    - Cortex M3 Processor
        - Instruction Phases
            1. Instruction fetch
            2. Data Read
            3. Operation
            4. Data Store

    - What is an embedded system
        - anything that has one or more microcontrollers is an embedded system

        - system is programmed into flash rom


    - Embedded Systems Have 4 characteristics
        1. Perform a single function

        2. Are tightly constrained
            - can be constrained within time, power, memory, physical space

        3. Operate in Real Time
            - need sensors and need to be able to react

        4. Space


    - Trends within microcontroller field
        - smaller, cheaper, lower power
        - larger ram / rom, faster processing
