Today we are starting Chapter 4 - Hardware Software Synchrnoization


- Synchonizing IO
    - Hardware States
        - Device can be off
        - device can be on but idle
        - device can be currently active

    - Device is active
        - 

    - Why do we need it?
        - waiting time
            - IO is often much slower than the microcontroller

        - IO Bound
            - the time for the software to read and process data is less than
                - time for the input device to create the new input

            - CPU faster than input data

        - CPU Bound
            - when the software read process is greater than the rate at which
              new input is created


            - Input data faster than CPU


    - Synchronization
        - 5 Mechanisms
            1. Blind Cycle
                - Read data after fixed wait time

            2. Bust Wait of Gadfly
                - Keep checking until the cpu is not bust

            3. Interrupt

            4. Periodic Polling

            5. DMA


    - Variety of IO ports
        - microcomputers perform digital IO using ports

        - port pins are programmed via software
            - parallel IO


    - Timing
        - Equations
            - algebraic mechanisms to describe time

        - Down Arrow means the time when the signal falls
