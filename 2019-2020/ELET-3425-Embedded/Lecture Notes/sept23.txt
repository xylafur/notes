        - Foreground threah

    - Interrupt
        - Backgound thread



- Debugging
    - Hardware tools
        - components hooked up to the microcontroller
        - Something like an oscilliscope

    - Intrusiveness
        - the debug is affecting the way the program behaves
            - Adding a print statments means that the program will take more
              cycles to execute
