This is basically a review of Micro P

The powerpoints are on blackboard

#   Chapter 1 - Intro to Embedded Systems
###############################################################################
- Objectives
    - Review computer architecture
    - Introduce E.S.
    - The design process


- Computer Architecture
    - A microprocessor
        - The thing that executes the software

    - A Microcomputer
        - Processor + Memory and other periperials

        - Like a desktop PC

    - Microcontroller
        - Essentially a microcomputer all in a single chip

        - We will be using TI in out class, LM3S1968

    - SH / HW Interface
        - may need extrnal electronics, such as ADC or amplifier


    - 4 IO ceategories of IO Interfaces
        1. Parallel
        2. Serial
        3. Analog
            - Sometimes microcontrollers have "analog pins" that internally
              connect to an ADC before going to the processor
        4. Time
            - Clocks?

    - Memory Mapped IO
        - Assigned addresses
        - Access IO like you are accessing memory

    - IO Mapped IO
        - Has seperate address space
        - Has seperate instructions for IO


    - Bus
        - We have multiple busses:
            - control
            - data
            - address

        - ARM Cortex M3 Buses
            - ICode Bus
                - fetch instructions from Flash

            - Decode Bus
                - fetch data or debug information from Flash

            - System Bus
                - Read/write data from RAM or IO Ports

            - Private Peripheral Bus
                - Accesses common peripherials
                    - Interrupt controller
