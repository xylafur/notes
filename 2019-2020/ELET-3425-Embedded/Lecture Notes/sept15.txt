- Software Design


- Finite State Machine
    - The Goal
        - You should have a goal whenever you have a project

    - Moore FSM
        - only a function of a current state

    - FSMs have Inputs and outputs


    - Traffic Light COntroller
        - In this case, the goals are
            - to minimize time waiting at a red light
            - to maximize traffic flow
            - to avoid accidents

        - Inputs / Outputs
            - Inputs
                - sensors for the two roads

            - Outputs
                - ouputs for each of the lights



- Homework
    - Draw FSM for 4 direction traffic light
