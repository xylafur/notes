- TTL (time to live)
    - how long do you get the bus for?





- DA (data avaliable)
    - how long with data be valid?

    DA = (falling_edge(G*) + t_to_enable, rising_edge(G*) + t_to_disable)

        - t_to_enable = [0, 38ns]
        - t_to_disable = [0, 38ns]

    - This is determined by the tristate buffer circuit





- DR (Data required)
    - the interval is determined by the timing of the FF

    - the FF bus must be valid 25ns before rising_edge(CLK)
        - this is the setup time

    - must remain valid until 5ns after the same rising_edge(CLK)
        - this is the hold time


    DR = (rising_edge(CLK) - setup_time, rising_edge(CLK) + hold_time)


- SHOULD ALWAYS:
    DA > DR

    - this is just to ensure we meet timing

- Always design for the worst case


- As soon as G* goes low, the bus is active for our use

- Hardware-Software Synchronization
    - Programming LCD Screen
        - HD44780-controlled LCD
            - We know that most LCD operations take less than 40 micro seconds
                - this is our blind wait time

            - No status feedback from device
                - software won't know anything about the status of the device

            - Operates on low power

            
        - Low Level Software
            - initializes the LCD controller
            - outputs to the LCD controller

        - Our Micro Controller
            - writes ascii characters to the LCD controller
