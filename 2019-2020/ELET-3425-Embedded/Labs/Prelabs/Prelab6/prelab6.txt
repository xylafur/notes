Read the section 3.9 of the textbook ‘Real-Time Interfacing to ARM Cortex
Microcontrollers – Embedded Systems by Jonathan W. Valvano’ for performance
debugging and profiling. Based on your reading answer the following questions
and upload them through link provided on Blackboard.

1. What are some of the most common Performance Measurement and Debugging tools?

    1. Counting the bus cycles
        - estimate the speed based on sum of execution time of assembly
          instructions

    2. Instrumentation Measuring with an independent counter
        - Since systick is a 24 bit timmer, as long as we think our thing will
          operate in less than 2^24 bus cycles we can use that to measure the
          time

    3. Instrumentation Output Port
        - Attach a scope to one of the GPIO pins on your MCU and then change
          the logic level of that pin at meaninful places

2. What do you mean by intrusive and non-intrusive techniques of performance evaluation?

    Nonintrusiveness is the characteristic or quality of a debugger that allows
    the software / hardware system to operate normally as if the debugger did
    not exist.

    Intrusive techniques will effect the execution of the system, such as a
    print statement taking a very long time, allowing the hardware to change
    state while the CPU is stuck handling the print.


3. What do you mean by profiling?
    - Type of performance debugging that collects the time history of program
      execution.

4. In what cases can the use of print statements for debugging be discouraged?

5. Briefly Explain. How does a systick timer works?
