Initilization:
    There are 3 ways to deal with it
        1: Assign an arbitrary number
        2: Just keep the garbage that was there
        3: use undefined (something that Algol languages did)
            The idea is that if you did not explicitly assign a value, it is 
            undefined, if you ue it your program crashes

    What do we want from a runtime support system / our compiler?
        We want to have as many errors as possible classified as syntax errors


    M[i, j]
    1 <= i, j <= m

    M[i, j] = M[i, j] + x

    (i, j, x)
        moving triples, n >> m^2

    If this fits in main memory, not interesting - O(n)

    However if M does not fit into main memory, thing become interesting because
    of swapping

    Lets assume that only 10% of M fits into main memory

    VMM:
        How many block must be retrieved

    move_input
    {
        read (i, j, x)
        M[i, j] = M[i, j] + x
    }
