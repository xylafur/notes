We have learned alot about electricity and electrostatic, so we will now be 
learning about similar concepts for magnets.  There are many things in common,
but many things are different.  

Vectors are used heavily in magnetics

There is a very close relationship between magnetism and electricsatatics
We analyze magnetic field lines differently than electric field lines

A loop rotating in a loop insde of a magnetic field will generate an electric 
field
    windmills, steam turbines, all use this principle to generate electricity

Introduction:
    a compass uses the earth's oriented magnetic field.  The needle on the 
    compass wants to align itself with the magnetic field

    Magnetic forces only effect moving electric charges

    We will see that in the context of magnetism, it is the motion of charges 
    that is crucial.  The faster the charges move the stronger the field


Magnetic Poles:
    Magnets have a north pole and a south pole.  Oposites attract, likes repel
    A permenent magnet will never change its poles.
        An objec that contains iron but is not magnetized is attracted to 
        either pole of a magnet

        There are a few elements which are attracted to magnets

        If you have a polorized object, or an object with some charge, and bring
        something that is neutral close to it, the neutral object will get 
        polarized and become attracted to the poloarized or charged object

Magnetic field of Earth:
    The earth itself is a magnet.
    The magnetic field is strong enough for us to feel it on the surface

    The geographic north pole is close to a magnetic south pole
        this is because the compass north pole points to the earth's south pole

    The earth's magnetic axis is not quite parallel to its geographic axis

    The magnetic field stops alot of em waves from the sun
        the sun produces solar winds, if the earth did not have a magnetic field,
        all of the charged particles that are produced would hit the surface.

Magnetic Monopoles:
    magnetic poles always come in pairs.
    There is no experimental evidence for magnetic monopoles

    Breaking a magnet in 2 yeields two magnets, not isolated poles

We defined an electric field as how a test particle responds or moves.

Electric current and magnets:
    if  a compass is placed on a wire with no current the compass is not effected

    if a current is passed through the wire, we see that the compass needle will 
    move

The magnetic field:
    a moving charge  creates a magnetic field in the surrounding space

    This magnetic field exerts a force on any other moving charge or current 
    that is present in the field

    Like an electric field, a magetic field is a vector field

    The symbol B is used to represent a magnetic field

    The direction of the magnetic field is defined by which way the north pole
    of a compass needle points at that poinut

Magnetic force ona moving charge:
    magnitude magnetic force is prooirtional to the velocity of a moving particle

    the magnetic force is represented as 

    F = qV x B, where both V and B are vectors and x is the cross product
        points purpendicular to velocity and magnetic field

        We can see that magnetic fields only effect moving charges

    the magnitude is 
        F = |q|*v*B*sin(phi)

RIght hand rule for magnetic force:
    gives the direction of the force on a positive charge

    curl fingers from V to B and your thumb points in direction of the force

    if the particle is negative, just reverse the sign of F from what it would be

imagine 2 charges with oposite charges but the same velocity:
    the charges are equal in magnitude but oposite in direction

    The forces they will experience will also be equal in magnitude but opposite

Magnetic Field Lines:
    a magnetic field can be represented by magnetic field lines

    we draw lines so that each line thorugh any point is tangent to the 
    magnetic field vector at that point

    The field lines never intersect.  Very similar to electric field lines

    Lines go out from north pole, into south pole

    Magnetic field lines ALWAYS form closed loops
    The lines are always circular as well, they do not directly go from one 
    pole to the other
        each line completes a loop

    Magnetic field lines are NOT lines of magnetic force
        the force on a charge partice through the field is perpindicular as we
        discussed earlier, given by v x B

How to quantify a magnetic field?

Magnetic field of a straight current carrying wire:
    the magnetic field will form radially (circularly) around the straight wire
    in a direction correlating to right hand rule
        point thumb in direction of current, the way your fingers curl is the
        direction of the field

    Dots represent vectors coming out from plane, x's represent vectors going
    into the plane

RECAP:
    One of the most fundamental things is the Magnetic force equation
        F = qV x B

        Charges at rest produce electric field.  FOr magneic field, charges have 
        to be in motion.  Moving charges generate a Magnetic Field, and a magnetic
        field effects moving charges

    We use the right hand rule to describe the direction of the magnetic field
    from current through a wire

Magnetic Flux:
    If we consider some area and image a magnetic field going through it with
    angle phi THe magnetic flux is then defined as 
        Magnetic Flux = Integral(B (dot) dA) = Integral(B*cos(phi)*dA)

    THe magnetic flux through any closed surface is 0

    THe SI unit of magnetic field is Testla, Gauss is also a common unit
        T = N/A * m
        1G = 10^-4 * T

Motion of charged particles in a magnetic field:
    Because the force is perpendiculr to the velocity, the foce cannot do any
    work.  
        Meaning it can change the direction of the velocity, but can never
        change the kinetic energy

        The megnetic field will never change kinetic energy; the magnetic field
        does not do work.

    Remember that the magnetic field only prodduces a force from a component
    of velocity that is perpendicular to the field.  

When charged particles accelerate, they produce radiation: known as van allen 
radiation

The magnetic force on a current carrying concuctor:

    if the field is perpindicular to the current
        F = nqvA * lB

    More generally:
        F = I * l x B
            where l is the vector length that points in the direction





3-23-2018: 
Magnetic dipole ina nonuniform magnetic field:
    The direction of the force will be changing depending on the magnetic field
    and current, or more explicitly the directions of those fields.
    The right hand rule still holds true

    We could use this, to have a current carrying loop be pushed away by a 
    magnetic field.
    There would be a magnetic moment in the oposite direction of the force

    A current loop can be thought of as another magnet

    A magnetic moment is the property of a magnet that interacts with an 
    applied field to give a mechanical moment
        A mechanical moment in this case would be either force or torque

There is another way to produce an magnetic field.  Electrons have a 'spin', there
are some elements that have an unpaired spin in the outermost orbital.  That spin
responds like a current carrying loop

In unmagnetized iron, there are many magnetic moments that are oriented randomly
in such a way that they cancel out

When this iron is brought in a magnetic field, the magnetic moments are all
aligned in the direction of the magntic field


How magnets work:
    the bagnetic field of the bar magnet gives rise to a magnetic moment in some 
    unmagnetized material (that has the property of magnetism, such as iron)

    Because the field of the bar is not uniform, the magnetic dipole is 
    attracted toward the magnet
        This is because of the same reason of the current carrying loop, the
        y components of the forces cancel but the x components point toward
        the magnet

Direct current motor:
    a rotor is a wire loop that is free to totate on an axis, the rotor ends 
    are attached to two curved conductors that form the commutator

    This rotor will rotate based on the way the current is directed and magnets
    are oriented
