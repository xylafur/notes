Caucuses and voter turnout:

    Iowa Caucus from 2008 video:
       Seems to only be people who are very enthusiastic about a certain rep

       people are really hyping up their candidate

    New Hampsure is the location of the first primary:
        tell them ur party, fill out a ballot and they count up the ballots at the end

        Types of Primaries (different states have laws about who can vote):
            In new hampsire any registered voter choose your party and you vote

    Texas has semi open primary, after you pick you can't switch

    Closed primary:
        Bernie sanders is an independent who usually votes with democrates

        In states with closed primaries, you have to register with a party:
            Such as new york, where many of bernie sanders supporters, who were
            not registered as democrafts, were not able to vote for him in the
            primaries
            
Frontloading:
    moving up dates that primary or cacuss is help, in the hopes that they will
    have more of a say in who gets elected


General Election Campaign:
    Starts with conventions, goes all of the way to november

    Every year, parties hold a convention in a major city.  The conventions are
    where all of the delegates go, and they select whichever nomonie
