Agenda setting:
    Priming:
        What occurs ehen the mdia affect the standards of people use to evaluate 
        political figures or the severity of a problem

        Basically gets the public to think about some specific things; meaning
        we will evaluate politiians relative to what the media decides to cover

        priming can be a double edged sword:
            ex George H W Bush:
                Bush put together a coalician to put pressure on sadam and get
                him out of kawait; this didn't work so there was a conflict that
                started.  This was all the media covered when it happened, the
                public believed that he was doing a good job.

    Framing:
        stating of an argument in such a way to emphasize one set of considerations

        Deals with HOW the media covers a story

        Framing Example: A proposed KKK Rally at OSU:
            There were two different headlines and story, which said the same thing

            "KKK Tests OSU's commitment to Free Speech" 
                and
            "Possible KK Rally raises saftey concerns"

            The way the story was framed changed peoples opinions about it


Fake News:
    Fake news has meany definitions:
        Clickbate
        distortion of the truth
        False stories
        True stories denounced as fake news

    CNN defines fake news as having a spectrum:
        Satire or parody is on the lesser side of the spectrum

    Has existed for a long time, but social media has allowed it to flourish.

    How prevelant is it?
        Every year, the oxofrd dictionary has a word of the year.  In 2016 it
        chose the word "post-truth"

    There was a story claiming that pope francis endorced donald trump:
        This was a completley fabricated story
