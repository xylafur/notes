Voterturnout:
    1960 was the year with the highest voter turnout

    Over the last 30 years, voter turnout peaked for the Obama Mccain election


    Voter turn out is lower than that of any other democratic industrionalized 
    countrie (Except for sweden)

Who participates in elections? Factors affecting political participation
    The single most important factor, is education
        the higher ones educational attainment, the higher pobabliolity that
        he or she will vote

    "The more you learn, the more you earn"
    When education is controled, then income does not matter much

    The older you are, the more likeley you are to vote

    Gender differences in voting has mroe or less disappeared: men and women
    have the same voter turnout

    Race does seem to have some influence on voter turnout:
        Whites used to outnumber blacks 
        In 2012, more blacks than whites voted

    How do we know? WHere does this data come from?
        Surveys

        There is the issue of social desirability bias:
            this is how people will lie for a survey to appear socially acceptable

    What about photo id laws?
        In democracy we have the premis that voting is considered sacred
        It is essential for a democracy that the vote is accurate and fair

        Republicans support voter id laws:
            they say that this is because it will prevent voter fraud

        Democrats argue that people who are eligble to vote may not have an id:

    
        Shelby County (Alabama) v. Holder
            Eric Holder was the attourney general for most of Obamas presidency
            He was upset over the preclearance requirement, which required that
            should they want to change their election in any way it had to be
            approved.  The supreme court ruled in favor ofthe plantiffs, this
            paved the way to voter ID law enforcment
