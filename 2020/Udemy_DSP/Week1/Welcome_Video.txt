Signal:
    Measurement of a physical phenomena that evolves over time.

    This could be pressure, voltage, light intensity or something else.


Digital signal:
    Just a sequence of measurements of a signal.  If you take mesaurements
    often enough, the result has all the relevant info.

Mathematical Framework
    Linear Algebra is the tool.  Digital signals are vectors in a vector space
