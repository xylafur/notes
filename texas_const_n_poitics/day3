Aristotle:
    Regarded as teh first political scientist

    He categorized government into many forms:
        Ruled by    True            Corrupt
        One         Kingship        Tyrant-dictator
        Few         Aristocracy     Oligarchy
        Many        Constitutional  Democracy

    He considered a government to be 'True' if it helped each citizen achieve 
    their full power
        He said that Aristocracy was true becuase being born in to it would mean
        you likely have the tools to become a skilled leader

        Oligarchy is rule by a few wealthy individuals.  They will rule in such
        a way they at least they hold onto their wealth but more than likely
        to expand their wealth

        Democracy as a corrupt form of government: the will of the people can 
        lead to consequences.  
        For 2 reasons, the US is not a true democracy
            We have universal basic rights that the majority can not vote out
            We vote for our represintatives, not for laws themselves
