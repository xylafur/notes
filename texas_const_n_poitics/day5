Today we continue with the declaration of independance
    Later this week we will cover the US const

    We want to know about important documents of the time that the constitution
    was based off of or pulled ideas from

THe Second COntinental Congress:
    Jefferson was the head of the committie that wrote the declaration
    of independence

John Locke:
    Comes into play in 2nd paragraph on declaration

    Political philosopher 

    Jocke Advocated many of the ideals from the declaration of independence 
    in hi writings

    Of this: we have certain rights that are unalienable, and if our government
    doesn't protect those rights, we should rise up against our governemnt and
    replace it with one that does respect those rights

    If you're going to overthrow a government, there needs to be some real
    reason, such as some ongoing severe problem

What injustices by the king do you think were most eregious?
    The king not allowing his "citizens" in AMerica the basic human rights that
    we are now able to enjoy; the king taxing the colonists without representation, 
    not giving them a voice or control over their own lives and land

Do you think that the DoI had anyh shortcomings? If so what were they, if not, 
why not?
    Not really, they spoke of everything they thought the king did wrong against
    them.   If anything could be added, maybe that they wre ready to back up
    their claim that they were an independent nation with force

    Lack of mention of women

The Articles of Confederation:
    first form of united states gov't

    Confederation:
        States, smaller regional governments, come together and form a national
        gov't for all of their purpose but retain their of sovereignty

        THe EU is an example of a confederation

    Unitary System:
        The national gov't is in place first and creates the state gov'ts

    In the US today, both the fed and state gov't get their power from the 
    constitution
