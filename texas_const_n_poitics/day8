the bill of rights:
    7th amendment: right to trial by jury in civil suits
        if the value of the lawsuit is over some threshold you have the right to
        a trial by jury

    8th amendment: no cruel and unusual punishment
        
    9th amendment: unlisted rights reserved for citizens
        absense from the constitution does not mean that citizens do not have
        that right
        
    10th amendment: reserved powers (powers not explicitly granted to the fed)
                    for the states

The US Constitution in International Perspective
    many other constitutions around the world are influenced by the us 
    constitution

    now adays, because there are so many constitutions around the world today, 
    the us isn't as strong as a model as it used to be.
        this is just because countries will more than likely just checkout
        what their neighbors are doing and copy them
