L1 - L2 is empty for 2 recursive languages
    not recursively enumerable, may take an infinite amount of time

If both languages are recursive:
    If we are looking for a particular word it is recursive
        this is because the word will either be accepted or rejected for both
        languages, then we can apply the operator to the result

    If we are trying to determine if they are empty:
        this will be recursively enumerable.  Because if the intersection or
        difference is empty, then we have to go through every possible word
        that exists in the lanague.  SInce there are an infinite amount of
        words that exist then its going to take an infinite amount of time,
        meaning it may not halt
