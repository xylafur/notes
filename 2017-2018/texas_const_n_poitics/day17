Polling:
    If a poll is done right then tha poll will give you the ability to know
    how particular people feel in a certain place
    Town halls are great, but they onl tell us about the people at the town
    hall and not the rest of the people in that town or district.

    So polls, if done right, give us a more accurate gauge of public opinion

Gallup Polls:
    George Gallup was from Iowa, in the course of developing pollings he was
    very optimistic, thinking that he dould give people in congress in 
    washington accurate data about how their consitiuints felt

Sampling Error:
