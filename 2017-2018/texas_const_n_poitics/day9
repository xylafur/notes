Civil Liberties
    Definition: "consititutionally established guarantees that protect citizens,
                 opinions, and property against arbitrary government interference"

        We want to put a "leash" on the government so that we are able to remain
        free.

    Differences between civil liberties and civil rights

        offers good arguments on why freedom of speech matters

        Gave rise to "marketplace of ideas"

    Why Freedom of speech?
        True (good) ideas suppressed:
            how do you know whats true? 
            Many of today's popular ideas were one anything but
            
            Ex: socrates put to death, 
                    he is regarded as one of the wisest men of all time
                christ crucified as blasphemer
                    christ is now regarded as a just person and a prophet
        False (Bad) Ideas suppressed:
            Even if its a false idea, seeing it (and arguing against it) can
            enable us to arrive at (or reinforce) the truth

            Few ideas are entirely true or false

The first amendment:
    Limitations of freedom of speech:
        Certain types of speech can be restricted
            Cannot slander or libel (intentionally lying about someone to 
                discredit someone) against someone
            Can't publish confidential documents
            Can't cause a panic
