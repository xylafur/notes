A democracy is supposed to represent the will of the people, so if the gov't
is going in the other direction, it is at least problematic

What is the corespondence between public opinion and public policy

If we have polling data and voting data and we notice a corespondence between
the two:
    we can say good, there is a corespondence
    But also, other than public opinion why might politicians vote a certian way
        Donors who promise them money 
        Their own opinion
        They vote along party lines
        
People will respond differently to the same questions at different times

To what extent are politicians beholden to public opion and how beholden
should politicians bbe to public opinon.
    In general, studies have shown that when public opinoon movces in a certain
    direction (loberal or conservative), policy outputs from both state and fed
    move in that same direction

25 years ago 12 year old girl was kidnapped at knifepoint
    There was a 200000 dollar reward for finding her

    when this happened, this was a national case

    They found out she was murdered, and eventually foud the killer
    He was in and out of jail all of his life, always commiting crimes
    more serious than the last

    The public began to demand that laws be changed to prevent another child
    from meeting the same fate
        In a direct response to this case, the california legislator
        considered the 3 strikes law.  On conviction of felony #3 you get
        automatically 25 years to life wihtout parole

    What is considered a strike?
        in most states it must be a violent strike
        in california shoplifting counted
            thouseands and thousands of people were arrested and stuck out
            and were put in jail for a long time

            That was hundreds of millions of dollars

        Lead to a reconsideration of the law that we will cover friday
