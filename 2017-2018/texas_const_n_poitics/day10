Civil Liberties:
    Freedom of Speech:
        The first amendment provides a very strong protection against many
        different forms of speech and expression.

        The first amendment does include protections for hate speech.
        
        Obsenity is not protected, but how do you determine what is obscene?
            A supreme court justice said "I know it when i see it" - he could
            not define it.

    Right to Privacy:
        Privacy: "The state of being free from intrusion or disturbance in one's
                  private life or affairs"
        Privacy is not explicitly anywhre in the US constitution
            the sepreme court has ruled that it is implied by the 1st, 3rd, 4th,
            5th, 9th and 14th amendments

        Right to privacy court cases:
            Griswold v Connecticut 1965,
                CT law prohibited the use of contraceptives, Griswold, an official
                with planned parenthood, was conducting classes which taught
                married women how to use birth control.  Enfocing this law 
                would mean that the police and the gov't in general would have
                to know about couple's intimate lives

            Eisenstadt v Baird 1972:
                Mass band the sale of cintraceptives, thus trying to influence
                what heppened in one's private life.  
                The gov't can't say what people do with their lives and what
                they do or consume at home

            Roe V Wade
                Norma MxCorvey "Jane Roe" a dallas woman sought an abortion

                Texas law prohibited abortions except when the health/life of
                the moher necessitated it, as determined by a physician
                Defendant was Henry Wade, the district attorney in dallas county

                Justice Blackmun wrote the majority opinion:
                    Tx law violated the right to privacy based on the due
                    process clause in the 14th amendment (it was to restrictive
                    in terms of only allowing abortion in very limited
                    circumstance)

                    The texas law was too sweeping

                This case broke abortion down into 3 trimester
                    1st: the govt has no right to interfere with a woman who 
                         wants to terminate her pregnancy
                    2nd: Gov't can enact laws aimed at protecting mother's health 
                    3rd: gov't can intervene to protect the child; the child is
                         now viable, the child could survive on its own, but
                         the mother's health must be protected

                    90% of abortions occur in 1st trimester

                Laws in 46 states were invalidated as a result of this ruling

                Many states have passes laws that will ban abortions effective
                immediately should Roe v Wade be overturned

                The ruling led to the establishment of pro-life and pro-choice
                movements

                The sate is prohibited from interfering with abortion, but has
                no obligation to allow access to it
                    Medicade is under no obligation to pay for abortions

            Planned Parenthood v Casey 1992:
                Prohibition of "undue burderns"

                Very confusing, much debate over its meaning

                Pinsilvaina had passed many laws regarding abortion,

                Informed consent, Parental notification and consent, a 24 hour 
                waiting period, repoting requirements by abortion providers wre
                all deemed to still be acceptable by the court case
