What is "politics":
    "who gets what, when and how' - Harold Lasswell 1936

    Political power can allow politicians to do much more
        such as getting money sent their  way rather than somewhere else

What is "government":
    "An organisation extending to the whole of society that can legitimately use
     force to carry out its decisions" - Dye 2001

    Extending to the whole of society:
        applicable to any form of gov't
