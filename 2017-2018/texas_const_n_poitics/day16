Today we continue over political socilization (which I missed) and start
to cover public opinion

On moday we introduced political socilization:
    how is it that, even while were small children, we first learn about govt?
        parents
        schools
        eventually college

Studys of college age students and collee students:
    we see that college is generally a time when studnets become more liberal
    give college students a servey as freshman and then another when graduate
        you can see the difference, which usually means students become
        more liberal

    Highschool students going to college tend to be more liberal initially
    than studnets who chose not to go to college

Adulthood:
    Once you're an adult, political view tend to harden.  When you're in your
    late 20's, they tend not to change that much, but people become more 
    conservative.  
    Bills to pay, taxes to pay children to raise, leads people to become
    slightly more conservative.  
    The issue of age on same sex marriage tends to be more accepted by
    younger generations

Marriage:
    People tend to marry people much like them
    People tend to aquire the same political beliefs as their spouse over time

Public Opinion:
    Definiton: Those opinions held by private persons which governments find 
               it prudent to heed

    To speak with precision of public opinion is a task not unlike coming to 
    grips with the holy ghost

For the rest of class we will be discussing why we should care about public
opinion and how we can gather the public opinion
