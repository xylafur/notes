I signed up for asignment 2 and 3

The nations founding and the constitution

Background of us:
    first english settlment, jamestown virgina, 1607
        after this there wre new settlments until we had the original 13 colonies

    around this time most governments were monarchs who were all powerful
        if you asked a king or a queen where they get power, they would say from god

    From Jamestown until the middle ofthe 1700's 
        colonies are founded but they are subject to the crown for the most part

        they did not need authority to do minor things, like murders and crime
        The british crown had to be consulted for anything beyond this

        In the 1760's there was a conflict known as the 7 years war, or french and indian war
            was fought on US soil
            british won but ended up with a big debt because of it

            this led to the stamp act, the sugar act, etc..
                tarrifs on certain kinds of goods used to pay of the britsh 
                war debt -- Taxation without representation

        Eventually the colonists form the first continental congress in 1774
            they called for a boycott of british goods
            Starts squabbles between colonists and british 

        By the second continential congress in early 1776
            seemed that war was closer

            Influenced by "common sense" by thomas paine
                Attacks the divine right of kings

                made colonists want to rebel against the british

            The declaration of Independence came from this


Voter Registration:
    Texas mid term elections are coming up

    Helps to ensure that people vote in the correct place, also keeps people
    from voting more than once

    US citizens must register themselves rather than the government doing it for them

    In some states (not in Texas) you can register online
        in Texas, you can go online to create a document that will be printed.
        You can then mail that document to the county register
