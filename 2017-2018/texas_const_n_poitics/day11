Abortion / The Right to Privacy:
    Most americans fit in the middle, most aren't either pro-life or pro-choice 

    In recent years, there have been differenecs in opinion in pro-choice movement:
        Older women or prochoice people tend to be more focused on every woman
        having the ability to get an abortion should they want one

        Younger generation is more about "reporductivec justice" which includes
        things such as contraception, poverty and equal pay

    Pro life movement:
        "right to life"

    HB 2:
        "House Bill 2"
        Texas law regarding abortion

        Being considered in a special session inm 2013:
            Stated that if an institution provides abortions it must
                have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital
                have those abortions occur in an ambulatory surgical center
                no perform abortion after 20-22 weeks

            pro choice arguments against this bill include 
                causing hospitals to refuse service from either political or
                financial pressure
                Also they feared that hospitals would want to avoid protestors

            There was a fillabuster that prvented it from passing

            But then the govenor called another special session in which it
            passed

            The supreme court eventually ruled that the texas laws were 
            unconstitutional because they went against the ruling of PP vs Casey
            and it was considered an undue burden
