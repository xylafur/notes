The colonies after the revolutionary war were very diverse
    They were all founded at different times, by different people, for many
    different reasons.
    They had different economic activities

THe articles of confederations:
    Drafted at continental congress in 1776

    Adopted in 1777

    All states have ratified them by 1781, so they go into effect and remain in
    effect until 1788

    Article 1 - out name as a new nation

    article 2 - "Each state retains is sovereignty, freedom and independence, 
    and every power, jurisdiction, and right which is not by the confederation 
    expressly delegated to the congress...."

    Under the articles of confederation, the continental congress was the only
    form of federal government
    This was mostly for discussing matters of war and peace and foreign policy
        basically anything else, education, roads, trade, money - each state
        did for itself

    Problems undef articles:
        hard to get anything done, or amend the document
        The states had to give money to teh continenntal congress 
            They did not, and there were no consequences

        Regulation of commerce was difficult, each state had its own set of laws
        and its own currency

        Shay's Rebellion:
            Daniel Shays, an indebted revolutionary war vet, led an insurrection
            against forclosures 
            The banks were trying to forclose their homes because they were
            away at war and not able to pay

            the veterans were supposed to ahve been payed by the congress
                but sense no one payed the continental congress, there was no
                money in the treasury

            Massathusets was not able to stop them alone
                they asked for help
                Virginia was the only state that helped them out

            Some of the founding fathers come together in Maryland, realizing
            that some serious changes need to be made to the Articles

The constitution:
    What is it:
        "The supreme law of the land"
        The legal foundation of this country:
            kind of a meta law that determines the constitutionality of other laws
        Also gives us a bill of rights

    Constitutional Convention:
        Lasts for the entire summer of 1787
        Basically at the beginning they decided they were gonna scrap the articles

        There were divisons, namely 2 groups
        -----------------------------------------------------------------------
        | Federalists                     | Anti Federalists                  |
        -----------------------------------------------------------------------
        | most numerous, very excited     | Had a very real fear, that if the |
        | SUch as washington, adams, ..   | national gov't were strengthened  |
                                          | they would have to much power and |
                                          | would abuse it.  Great brittian   |
                                          | all over again                    |
                                          | The most famous was thomas jeff.

    The preambles
        THe Articles of Confederation:
            "We the undersigned delegates of the states"
        THe constitution:
            "We the people of the united states"
            This shows that the fed can now pass laws that affect people directly

    Representation in Congress:
        Everyone thought that congress would be the most powerful branch of 
        gov't, how to set it up was a big issue.  THere was much debate about
        how many representivatves for each state

        The Virginia Plan
            Proposed by James Madison
            Wanted 2 chambers of congress
                A lower house of representatives
                And a higher senate
            Each camber was based on population of the state

        New Jersey Plan:
            Favored by smaller states
            Feared that smaller states would be smothered by the larger states
            if congress was based on population

            They proposed one chamber with 2 seats per state, all states equal
            
        Eventually the conneticet delegation proposed a compromise, 
        house and senate

        Slavery:
            never explicitly mentioned in the const
            How Would slaaves be counted? 
                3/5 compromise

    Constains 7 articles:
        1, 2 nd 3 describe congress, the presidency and courts

        4 - Full faith and credit clause:
            Any public act that one state does, all other states are required
            to aknowleddge
                such as a drivers license
