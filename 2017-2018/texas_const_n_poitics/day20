Continuing with the media

We were discussing our responsibilities to consuming media

Types of News media:
    we seperate into traditional and new forms of news

    Traditional:
        newspapers
        network news
        radio 
        magazines
        satire

    Newer Forms:
        Cable news (24 hour news)
        podcasts
        social media
        blogs
        other online sources

Overall impact of media on the public
    During WW2, walter lippmann (a united states media observer)
        He observed that hitler was using the radio to get his message to all
        germans, using it to spread his propoganda

    Lippmann said:
        "Where all men think alike, no one thinks very much"

    Now adays we have easy selective exposure for media
        we have basically a buffet of news media

My top 3 news outlets:
    npr
    bbc
    reddit

    Yes I generally agree with what they say, not always.  Honestly a very 
    liberal mix of media

Selective Perception:
    If we are foced to watch news media that we don't agree with, will it 
    influence us in any way?  Probably not, because of selective perception

    "Tendency that is inconsisten with one's prior predisoisitions"

Motivated reasoning
    "Interpreting news in a manner thats consistent with your beliefs"

    Seems similar to belief bias
   
How can the media affect us then?

Agenda Setting:
    Maybe the news media can't tell you what to think, but they can tell you 
    what to think about

    Each media organization has to decide what they will cover or write about
    on a particular day
