Magnetic field due to a single charge with constant velocity

    The equivalent of columbs law for magnetic forces

    (magnetic_constant * q* V x r) / (4 * pi * ro**2)

        Where r is a unit vector from point charge to where the field is measured
            the point we are measuring the field at relative to the charge

        ro is the distance from the point charge o where the field is measured


Magnetic field of a current element:
    dB = (magnetic_constant * I * dl x r) / (4 * pi * ro**2)

        r again is the unit vector
        dl is a vector of length dl in direction of the current

    Basically the same equation as before but for a current carrying wire

    This explains things like planetary magnetism, cause by currents circulating 
    in the core

Exam is this friday at 4, our class will be replaced by review with no recitation

How to study:
    In addition to required stuff, he says use the problems at the back of the book,
    the questions at the end of the chapters


We will learn Ampere's Law:
    how to calculate the magnetic field of a symetric current dirtibutions

    The magnetic equivalent of Gauss's Law

    Usually magnetic fields are procuced by currents
        though there are excetions we will cover

Solenoid: Coil that carries crrent
    Multiple current carrying loops to generate a powerful magnetic field

    |                                                       -a

    We are trying to find the field at point p

    We have the current carriny wire vertically and the the magnetic field 
    horizontally, the line from the top of l to p is the vector from the section
    of l (dt) to p, thus r
    
    ro is the magnetiude of thawt vector (sqrt(x^2 + y^2))

    dl is upwward pointing
        dl x r is a vector that points into the plane (from right hand rule)

    dB = (magnetic_constant) / (4 * pi) * I * (dl x r) / r^2

       = (magnetic_constant) / (4 * pi) * I * dy * -k  / r^2

       = (magnetic_constant) / (4 * pi) * I * dy * -k  / (x^2 + y^2) 


       We integrate this from -a to a

    => B = (magnetic constant) * I / (4 * pi) * (2*a / (x * sqrt(x^2 + a^2)))


    Ifthe wire is infinitely long, sw can substitute (x^2 + a^2) with a^2


    => B = magnetic_constant * I / (2 * pi * ro)

    We will simplify this alot with Amper's law


Magnetic Field of a straight current-carrying conductor
    If you have a wire that carries current, then we know thatit produces a 
    magnetic field, the direction of this field is given by the right hand rule

    Our thumb is in the direction of the current and the field is in the direction
    that our fingers curl


    If the net current is 0, information can be transfered with no power transformsqrt


Force between parallel current carrying conductors:
    if we have two wires that are patallel with a current flowing in the same direction
    for both of them:

        Each wire will produce a magnetic field, so each wire creates a force on the other


    If the wires carry current in the same direction they attract, if its opposite
    directions they repel
        for current: oposites repel, like attract


    The magnetic force per unit length:
        F / L = (magnetic_constant * I * I') / (2 * pi * r)
            where I and I' are the currents in the two wires
            r is the distance between the wires


Ampere:
    It is a specific Current:
        the current for 2 parallel conductors of infinite length 1 meter apart 
        in empty space that causes force of 2 * 10^-7 newtons per unit length



Magnetic FIeld of a circular current loop
    Imagine a loop of radius a with counterclockwise currentI

    We want to calculte the magnetic field on the axis of the loop

    This field will only have an x component (because the y component will cancel)

    Bx = mag_constant * I * a^2 / (2 *( x^2 + a^2)^(3/2))


    Remember we can imagine a current carrying loop as a magnet, and field lines
    always go from north pole to south pole

Recap:
    A current carrying wire produces a magnetic field.
    We can determine the intensity of a magnetic field at a particular point

    The direction of the magnetic field is given by straight wire

    Two current carrying wires placed next to eachother either attract or repel
    based on the releative directions of both of their currents

    The magnetic field in a current carrying loop can be determined again by
    the right hand rule
        curl your fingrs in direction of the current, field is in the direction
        of the thumb


Ampere's Law:
    Magnetic analog of gauss's law

    closed_loop_integral(B (dot) dl) = closed_loop_integral(B * dl (parallel components))
    = B * closed_loop_integral(dl) = (magnetic_constant) * I 


    The enclosed quantity is the current through this loop

    The line integral of the total magnetic field is the sum of the currents
    
    The general statement:
        
        closed_loop_integral(B (dot) dl) = (magnetic_constant) * I_enclosed


Computing the magntic field for a long cylindrical conductor

    The current is to the left, the magnetic field goes over the cylendar


    R is the radius of the cylendar, r is the radius of our surface

    The magnetic field inside the conductor

        step 1:
        
        the magnitude of the field in the cylendar is B{r)

        accorgding to amperes law

                  ->        ->
        integral(B(r) (dot) dl) = (magnetic_constant) * I_enclosed


        step 2:

        B(r) is equal in magnitude all along the loop, since we are going all
        around the cylendar, 
    
        we can ssimply multipld B and dl because they are always parallel

        closed_loop_integral(B(r) * dl) = B(r) * 2 * pi * r = magnetic constatnt * I / (pi * R^2)


        step 3:

        = magnetic_constant * I /(pi * R^2) * (pi * r^2)
                                     ^
                                     | current density per cross sectional area


        = magnetic constant * I * r^2 / R^2
                    

    THe magnetic field outside the field
        step 1 and 2 will be the same.  The left hand side of the equation is the
        same.  The right hand side will be different because the loop now encloses
        the entire wire


        B(r) * 2 * pi * r = (magnetic_constatn) * I


For a long, straight current carrying conductor
    
    B = (magnetic_constant) * I / (2 * pi * r)


    A thin wire is the same as a thick wire as long as you only measure the field

    r is the distance from the center of the conductor to the point you are 
    measuring the field


A thick wire with uniform charge behaves like an infinatesimally thin wire

Lets think about electrostatics again:
    IN a parallel plate capacitor, there are two plates with q and -q.  THe 
    electric field outside is 0, but the field inside is uniform.

    There is something anagolous in magnetism witha solenoid


Solenoid:
    A surled wire that also increases in one direction (electromagnet)
    the same as many current carrying loops placed next to eachother

    If the solenoid is infinately long, the magnetic field inside is constant
    and is given by (magnetic_constant) * n * I


    There are two kinds of magnets:
        permanent magnets and electromagnets

    Permanent magnets have a fixed magnetism, electromagnets can create any
    desired field by driving a specific current through the wire


    Outside the solenoid the magnetic field is 0

Field of a solenoid:


We haven't talked about where magnetism comes from at the microscopic level

The Bohr Magneton:
    If an electron goes around some axis, the electron will enerate a magnetic field

    THe bohr magneton is the unit for the angular moment of an electron

    (magnetic dipole moment) = e / (2 * m) * L
    (bohr magneton) = eh / (4*pi * m) = 9.274*10^-24 J/T
        where L is the angular momentum
            L can only take some discrete values (because of some quantum stuff)
        e is the charge of electron, m is the mass
        h is planks constant


Paramagnetism and diamagnetism:

    K = relative permeability
        dimensionless factor

    paramagnetism:
        the one we are most familliar with, permanent magnets

        if placed in a magnetic field, it will change the magnitude (and possibly
        direction) of the field it was placed in because you would add the fields

    dismagnetism:
        material that is not magnetic, but develops a magnetic moment when placed
        in an electric field

        The ammount tby which the relative pereability differs from unity
        is called the magnetic susceptibility

        x = K - 1


    If you place a superconductor in a magnetic field, the magnetic field inside
    the superconductor is 0, always 0
        THe magnetic field lines will go around the superconductor
        the field lines can't go through the super conductor

    ferromagnetism:
        iron is an example

        atomix magnetic moments line up parallel to eachother in regions called
        domains, these domains will point in different directions to cause an 
        overall magnetic field of 0

        When there is no externally applied field, the domain magnetizations 
        are randomly oriented


    Anti ferro magnet:
        neighboring atoms have moments that point in different directions

        on average the moment is 0
