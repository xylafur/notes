Resisivity:
    For metals, typicaly increases with increasing temperature

    For semi conductors, it decreases with increasing temp
        obviously very different than for metals
        SO they are better conductors at higher temps

Superconductors:
    Its own state of matter

    At temperaturs below Tc, the resisivity is 0
        At some point when decreasing the temp, the resisivity just jumps to 0

    mercury has a Tc of something like 20 Kelvin, lot of metals when cooled to
    a certain state become superconductors

    First discovered in early 1900's, 
        In 1986 there was a breakthrough where 2 scientists at IBM discovered a
        material that is a insulator at higher temperatures, but below 35K it is
        a superconductor.

        First time superconductivity was discovered in something that isnt a 
        metal at higher temperatures

        At UH professor just a few months after discovered a material that was
        a super conductor at Tc = 93K

        Later there was a material discovered in Japan with Tc=103K

        Superconductivity is now one of the biggest forms of research

    THey also behave strangley in magnetic fields, they repel any magnet

    Once current has been established in a superconducting field, it continues
    indefinitely without the presnece of any driving field
        
Resistance:
    The resistance of a conductor is 
        R = p * L / A

        This shows that resistance depends on shape and size of the material

    Ohms Law:
        V = I*R
            potential is proportional to the current times resistance

    Resistor  are color coded
        the first 3 colored are the resistance and the last is tolerance
            The first 2 are the digirts and the 3rd is the multiplier
            THe last as said is the tolerance
For capacitors Q = C * V, or V = Q/C or the potential is proportional to the 
charge stored.  In the case of resistance, i t is proportional to thecurrent and
resistance
    Later we will cover an inductor, where the potential difference is proportional
    to the rate of change of a conductor? (didn't catch evverything)

Not every circut element obeys ohms law
    Diode:
        The relationship between I and V is not linear
        If the potentnail difference is negative the current is very small
        THis means that current only flows in one dierection, or rather only
        conducts in one direction


Electromotive Force:
    What drives a current?
        We have been saying its the potential difference, but it is more 
        general than that.
        The electromotive force (not actually a force,  it is a potential 
        difference but more general) is what  drives current.

    "The influence that makes current flow from lower to higher potential"
        "And a circut device that provides emf is called a source of emf"

    emf is represented by that backwaards 3 / capial curly e characer

Internal Resistance:
    real sources of emf have internal resistance

    V = emf - I * r
        where r is the internal resistance
        I is current though the source

        So the actual potential difference a bulb in a circut will recieive is 
        slightly smaler than the emf

Ammeter is always connected in series, a voltmeter is always connected in parallel

Potential changes:  
    In series
        The potential will drop everry time it encounters a resistor, but the
        current will remain constant, the current can be determend with ohms
        law and the total resistance of the circuit

Energ and power in electric circuits:   
    When current flows througha  resistor, it gets hot
        the battery is supplying energy and that energy is dissipted as heat

    The ammount of energy disipated can be determined by :
        P = V * I
            power = potential differenct * current in circut element
        this is the rate at which we have to do work
    also
        P = V * I = emf*I - I^2 * r = I * (emf - I*r)

Metallic conduction:
    Resisivity is determened by intrinsic properties, but where does that come
    from?
    At the microscopic level:
        In a conductor, electrons are free to move around (at least in ideal)
        but in a real conductor there is a fininte resistance because the
        electrons are not able to completley move.  The electrons will colide
        with all of the obsticles in its path (such as impurities or the ions
        and atoms because they vibrate slightly)
            These vibrations are known as phonons
