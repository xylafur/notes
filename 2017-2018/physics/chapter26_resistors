Resistors
    we will learn about resistors in both series and parallel.  
    Rules to apply to any circut with more than one loop
    using ammeter, voltmeter, ohmmeter or potentionmeter

    Learn how to analyze circuts with both resistors and capacitors

Intro:
    Real life circuts are generally very complicated and they contain many
    combinations of resistors in both series and in parallel.  

    In this chapter we only consider DC circuts
        a current in which the direction of the current does not change with time
        Flashlights and automobile wiring systems are examples of DC

    Household electrical power is supplied in the form of Alternating Current

    DC is more dangerous than AC

    AC is more complicated to deal with than AC, often you have to use diff eq


Resistors in Series:
    The current is the same through all of the resistors, then using ohms law
    the equivalent resistance is the sum of the resistances.

    There is a potential drop across each resistor

    V = V1 + V2 + V3
    IR = IR1 + IR2 + IR3
    IR = I(R1 + R2 + R3)
    R = R1 + R2 + R3

Resistors in Parallel:
    Each resistor has the same potential difference because there is no 
    potential drop.  Since the wires are all the same conductor, the potential
    is the same.  
    The current drops as it splits into the other branches

    The recipricol of equivalent resistance is the sum of the recipricols of all
    of the resisors.  

    I = I1 + I2 + I3
    V/R = V1/R1 + V2/R2 + V3/ R3, V = V1 = V2 = V3
    1/R = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3

Series and Parallel Combination:
    Simplify each part that is easy to simplify into a single resistor or the
    combined resistance,  Repeat until there is only one resistor left, that is
    the total resitance.

Kirchhoff's Rules;
    Someimtes you will encounter circuts where they are in neither series or
    parallel

    Resistors are in parallel only if there are no batteries or other elements
    in the way of other resistors
   
    A junction is a point where three or more conductors meet
    WHen you see any junction, the total current flowing into the junciton is 0

    A loop is any closed concucting path
    For any closed loop, the sum of the potential differences is 0 around any loop
