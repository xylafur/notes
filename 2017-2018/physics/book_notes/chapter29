Electromagnetic Inductance:
    Electricity is generated through electromagnetic induction: a process in
    which a change in magnetic flux through a circut generagtes emf and current

    The central principle to induction is Faraday's Law which relatd enduced
    emf to changing magnetic flux in any loop

29.1 Induction Experiments:
    induced current - moving magnetic field through circut to generate current
        -paited with induced emf

    The comment element in all of the experiments listed is a change in a magnetic
    flux through a coil connected to a galvanometer.  The flux changes either
    because the magnetic field changes or because the coil is moving through a 
    nonuniform magnetic field
    
    induced emf is proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux 
        the direction depends on wether flux is increasing or decreasing

29.2 Faraday's Law:
    magnetic flux is basically number of field lines thorugh a given surface

        d(flux) = B (dot) dA = B dA cos(th)

        (flux) = B (dot) A = B A cos(th)
            if B is uniform, else itegrate

    Faraday's induction:
        (emf) = - d(flux)/dt


    Direction of induced emf:
        we can find direction using faraday's induction with some rules

        1: define a positive direction for A
        2: From directions of A and magnetic field, determine sign of flux
        3: Determine sign of flux, if positive increasing, else decreasing
        4: Determine direction of induced current using right hand 
            Curl fingers around A vector with thumb pointing to A

            if the induced current is positive it moves in the direction of
            your fingers, else in the opposite direction

    Lenz's Law:
        Induction effect tends to oppose the change that caused it.

        FOr example teh field generated through a loop by a changing flux will
        be in the oposite direction of the original magnetic field

    Total emf in a coil with N turns is given by:
        (emf) = -N * d(flux)/dt

    Generators as Energy Converters:
        the induced emf doesn't come from nowhere, the energy is supplied by
        whatever body exerts the force that kept the rod moving

29.3 Lenz's Law:
    Method for determining the directrion of an induxed emf

    The direction of any manetic induction effect is such as to oppose the
    cause of the effect

    Induced current opposes the change in flux through the circut

    Lenz's law gives only the directoin of the induced current, the magnitude
    of the current depends on the resistance of the circut.  The greater the
    circut resistance the less the induced current that appears to opose any
    change in flux - the easier it is for a flux chagne to take effect.

    Flux through a loop of zero resistance never changes.  in this case though,
    the induced current will continue to flow even after the induced emf has
    disappeared


29.4 Motional Electromotive Force:
    If we move a positively charged rod through a magnetic field

        a    B                  ^   E
      x | x x                   |   |
        |                       |   |
      x | x x  v                |   |
        |------>                F   v
      x | x x
        |
      x | x x
        b

      The force is given as you would expect F = qv x B in the upward direction
      towards a
      This creates an excess of positive charge at the upper end a and negative
      charge at b.  This creats an electric field E in a direction oposite to
      the magnetic force
      Charge continues to accumulate at the ends of the rod until E becomes
      large enough for the downward elecric force to cancel exactly the upward
      magnetic force and
        qE = qvB

      The potitinential difference is equal to:
        V = EL = vBL

    Now we place this rod on a u shaped conductor.  No magnetic field acts on
    the stationary component, but the charge from the ends of the rods
    redistributes itself along the stationary conductor creating an electric
    field.  The moving rod has become a source of emf.

        emf = vBL

                I
            <---------
        x   x   x   x   x
          |-----------|-----    ^
        x | x   x   x | x       |
          |           |---> v   | emf
        x | x   x   x | x       |
          |-----------|-----
        x   x   x   x   x
                I
            --------->

    The induced current can be obtained by
        vBL = IR


    Generalizing:
                 ->  ->        ->
        d(emf) = (v x B) (dot) dl

        (emf) = (closed_loop_integral) (v x B) (dot) dl

        Which is also equal to the negative change in magnetic flux
